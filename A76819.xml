            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>But firſt, I will tell thee what I was, and now am, that thou mayſt ſee Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, calling poore creatures out of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to himſelfe; I was brought up by my parents in my youth, to learne, hall <hi>mary, Pater noſter,</hi> the <hi>Beliefe,</hi> and learne to read, and where I ſerved my apprenticeſhip little more was to be found; but in that time, I ſpeake, without any boaſting, to the praiſe of Gods grace, he ſhind in ſome meaſure into me, minding me of eternity, and my ſoules

Well, I fell to reading the <hi>Practiſe of Piety,</hi> Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi> and by theſe, or rather the Spirit, I got a little per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading of Gods love to my ſoule. Well, my time being out, <hi>I</hi> ſet up for my ſelfe; and ſeeking out for a wife, which with long waiting and difficulty, much expence and charge, at laſt I got; Four children, God gave me by her, but he hath taken them and her all againe too; who was a woman of a thouſand for good nature.

Well, thought I, if comfort be any where, it is in God; and ſo fell to meditating of theſe Scriptures; but no more of this, nor another tedious line; onely mark Gods dealing with his people in afflictions, which is moſt ſeen in that fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; inſtance <hi>Peter, Paul, Daniel,</hi> and the three Children.

I dare ſay to thee, whoever thou art, if the Spirit of God be in thee, lend him thy ſleep, or meditation, when thy buſineſſe of the world is ever, and thy Spirit quiet, he will feed thy thoughts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond thy expectation; I dare pawn my life for it, theſe few lines was brought to my hand in this way: and therefore try and ſee, if <hi>William Blakes</hi> words be not true.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:171624:11"/>the ſecond <hi>chapter,</hi> and the ſeventh <hi>verſ. To him that overcomes will I give to eat of the Tree of Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This tree is Chriſt, and his leaves are for the healing of the Nations, <hi>Rev.</hi> the 22. and the 2. <hi>v.</hi> And in the laſt of the 10 <hi>v. A Crown of life.</hi> And in the latter end of the 11. <hi>v. A promiſe of no hurt, by the ſecond death.</hi> In the 17. <hi>v. A promiſe to eat of the Manna that is hid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Manna was the ſweet food that the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael</hi> fed on in the Wilderneſſe; Chriſt is this <hi>Manna,</hi> but his ſweetneſſe is a hidden thing to the carnall world; and in the 25. <hi>A promiſe to rule over Nations,</hi> and further, <hi>I will give him the morning Star:</hi> this Star is Chriſt, <hi>as Peter tels us,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Wait untill the day dawn, and the Starre ariſe in your hearts.</hi> In the 15. <hi>ver.</hi> of the 3. <hi>chap.</hi> Chriſt tels his Church, <hi>That he that overcomes ſhall be clothed in white array. I, then ſhall he ſtand with boldneſſe before Chriſt, when Kings and Princes ſhall cry to the hills and mountains to fall and cover them,</hi> Revel. the 16. And further, <hi>I will not put out his name out of the book of life.</hi> and in the 12. <hi>ver. I will make him a ſtanding Pillar in the houſe of my God, and I will write on him the name of my God, and the name of the City of my God, and my name:</hi> The name of my God, that is, he ſhall be ſo filled with his divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that it ſhall be as viſible as a name in his forehead.</p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:171624:11"/>
               <p> And now in the 21. <hi>ver.</hi> which I firſt mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, a further promiſe is laid downe, as if Chriſt had not enough yet ſpoken, to engage his Church againſt hers and his enemies, namely, the world, fleſh, and devill.</p>
               <p>Well, according to my light, I ſhall hint at the meaning of Chriſt in theſe words: and firſt,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve.</hi> The univerſallity of the promiſe, it is a promiſe to him, any him; high, low, rich, poor, young old, bond, or free, man or maſter, maid, or miſtreſſe: O but the world does not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſo; one gaines the victory, and another gets the honour, or reward many times.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, What is meant by overcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, ſurely to get the maſterdome, or upper hand with thoſe we encounter with: this maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is got two wayes, by a Captain, or a ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, by a Captain, or a Champion; ſo <hi>David.</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged with <hi>Goliah,</hi> and his ſlaying him was <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raels</hi> victory, and he in this was a type of our <hi>David,</hi> our Chriſt, who hath ſlain and triumpht openly over our enemies upon the croſſe.</p>
               <p>And therefore ſaith Chriſt to his Diſciples, <hi>be of good cheare, I have overcome,</hi> as in <hi>John</hi> the 16, the laſt. Secondly, <hi>We do overcome likewiſe, when we doe by the ſtrength of Chriſt oppoſe and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the pollutions of the world.</hi> In this ſence ſaith <hi>John, Greater is he that is in you, then he that is in this world:</hi> and yet not, but that a poor ſoule may be foyld, and ſeemingly wholly overcome, as
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:171624:12"/>
                  <hi>David,</hi> but yet <hi>David,</hi> by renewing grace he gets up and fights, and like <hi>David</hi> in concluſion, wholly overcomes <hi>Saul</hi> and his houſe.</p>
               <p>Again, he may be ſaid to overcome two waies. Firſt, Comparing himſelfe with himſelfe, <hi>I was ſuch a ſinner, and ſuch a ſinner, but now I thanke God I am no more the ſame man.</hi> Secondly, Hee may be ſaid to overcome, comparing himſelfe with the world, who lies, lives and wallows in all kinde of polutions and defilements; <hi>Revel.</hi> 16. there is a bleſſing promiſed to ſuch a one; <hi>Behold ſaith Chriſt I come as a Thief in the night: bleſſed is he that keepes his garments undefiled,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, What is meant by Chriſts Throne, and by the Fathers Throne, ſurely here is meant both one thing, namely, the Glory of God, I ſay, the Glory of God is the thing meant, the eteruall Glory of God is the Throne on which Chriſt ſits on, and in which you muſt fit alſo.</p>
               <p>Doth Chriſt ſit in this glory of God, Chriſt your Husband, Chriſt your Head, Chriſt your Vine? then muſt you O Chriſtians too, for ye are inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perable.</p>
               <p>Where ſhould the Bride ſit but by the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome? Where ſhould the Members be but with the Head? Where ſhould the Branches be but with the Vine?</p>
               <p>O poore gentile ſinner, what glory is deſign'd for thee?</p>
               <p>But fourthly, What is meant by ſitting down
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:171624:12"/>in Chriſts Throne, or Gods Glory.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It denotes a ceſſation, or reſt, ſo you know Chriſt is ſaid to enter into his reſt, as he is ſet down with his Father in glory. And <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, there remains a reſt for the people of God, aluding to that, ſo that to ſit down with Chriſt in his Throne is to ſit with Chriſt in the Glory of God; <hi>Moſes</hi> was but a while in the Mount with God, and yet his face ſhined, ſo that <hi>Iſrael</hi> could not behold him. O how will thy face ſhine, when thou ſhalt ſit down with Chriſt in the true glory of God; <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaw him in fire, ſmoake, and thunder: but thou ſhalt ſee him in Chriſt, a loving, kinde and tender father, a father rejoycing over thee, even as a bridegroome rejoycing over his bride, to do them good, ſaith the Lord, in <hi>Iſai.</hi> O how well pleaſed was <hi>Jacob</hi> when he had his <hi>Joſeph?</hi> O friends, God will ſweetly pleaſe himſelf, as I may ſo ſay; when Chriſt ſhall ſay, <hi>he are am I and all the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren thou haſt given me, make them welcome Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they are my ſons and daughters whom I dearly loved, &amp; dearly bought:</hi> O ſeeing now I have them, I am at reſt, while they were in the world, toſſed with afflictions, and troubled with temptations, my heart was not at reſt, but ſeeing now I have them, and from thoſe things have freed them, I will ſet them in my Glory, where they ſhall ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſing: thus,</p>
               <p>Farewell all ſin and ſorrow, which now ſhall be no more, my work and labour is over, and nothing
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:171624:13"/>now remains but reſt, and joy, and glory: O this is a ſweet ſitting down indeed for a ſoul toſt and tumbl'd with ſinne and ſorrow, to be brought from all, to reſt for ever.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This ſetting in Chriſts Throne, or Gods glory denotes a welcome unto Chriſt; we bid them ſit down that are welcome unto us, take them by the hand and ſet them down by us: O friends, Chriſt will one day take you by the hand, lead you to the Father, preſent you as his Spouſe, the Father will take both Chriſt and yee, and ſet you both down in his own Glory: and in that day ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Yee ſhall know the Father is in me, and I in you;</hi> then ſhall yee know the Fathers love too, as Chriſt ſpeakes, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. <hi>laſt v.</hi> O Chriſtians yee will never know this love, nor your union, the ſtrength, glory, ſweetneſſe of it, till that day commeth, but in that day yee ſhall know the relation your ſouls ſtand in to God, to Chriſt. You will know him then to be a Father indeed, and not in name onely, you will finde ſo much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly love and tenderneſs towards you, that your ſouls ſhall lye ſteeping in it like Sugar in wine.</p>
               <p>If a little taſte of Gods love now be ſo ſweet, O what will it be when you ſhall lye night and day ſoaking in it, and wholly melted by it into holy praiſes.</p>
               <p>Here a gracious heart mourns for want of love to God, to Chriſt, but this want ſhall be ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when the Father and you perſonally meet,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:171624:13"/>which day is a comming, and I tell you this, till this day commeth, yee will never know what the love of God and Chriſt is.</p>
               <p>Now a drop is ſweet, but how ſweet will it be when it ſhall be like a flowing Fountain in you. O friends, in that day yee ſhall be like as a Veſſell thats ſet under a Fountain Cock, alwayes full and alwayes running over: Now ſaith <hi>David,</hi> thy loving kindneſſe is better then life. O but then he will ſay nothing but ſtand; ſtand, pore, and admire; I admire to al eternity: when great and undeſerved love is ſhewn unto us by ſome one unexpected, how do we admire, and as it were ſtudy and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der why ſuch kindneſſe ſhould be ſhewn unto us.</p>
               <p>O precious chriſtian, thou wilt one day ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire indeed to think, that ſuch love ſhould be ſhown to ſuch a dead dog; as that good man ſaid before the King, ſo wilt thou ſay, O my God and King, what am I, that thou ſhouldeſt love a poor Gentile ſinner, to keep me in thy preſence, to have me in thine eye, to ſet me in thy throne, that thou maiſt talk with me, and tell me there thy thoughts of old. O great and glorious God, why art thou ſo kind to worme, <hi>Jacob.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, by ſitting down in the throne of Chriſt or Gods glory, it denotes reſpect and eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation: we uſually bid them ſit down, whom we beſt reſpect and eſteem.</p>
               <p>O happy chriſtian, how art thou eſteemed of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:171624:14"/>the Son and Father, that thou ſhouldeſt ſit down with them: the world hates thee, ſo farre as Chriſt appears in thee: yea, it cannot but hate thee ſo farre, I ſay it hates thee, though it love thee other wayes as a friend, and kinſman, or harmleſſe man: but I ſay, ſo farre as thou refuſeſt to comply with their wayes, and wink at their faults, to ſpeak of their folly, to ſigh at their joy, and mourn at their laughter, ſo farre, I ſay, they cannot but hate thee: but ſo farre as thou wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt by their example, and walkeſt by their rule, and ſpeakeſt them fair, thou pleaſeſt them well to ſmooth them thus up, by laughing, and ſaying, and doing as they; I ſay, thus far happily the world may not ſlight thee, but eſteeme thee, though Chriſt be grieved by thee: but ſtill I ſay, ſo farre as you make Chriſt your rule, his word your law, his work your pleaſure, and ſervice your delight, not at all caring who be pleaſed or diſpleaſed, ſo Chriſt be honoured and obeyed: this, I ſay, will make the world hate you, and ſo it did Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Well, the world ſlights thee, and ſhufes thee; ſo far as they ſee Chriſt appearing in thee: doe not thou be troubled, Chriſt will one day take thee, and embrace thee as a man doth his lover.</p>
               <p>O thou ſhalt ſit and ſup with Chriſt. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.20. thou ſhalt ſit at his table, and ſtand by his ſide, yea cut on his trencher, and feed on his dainties, which is the feaſt of fat things God ſpeaks of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:171624:14"/>in Eſaiah. <hi>Behold I will make in this mount a feaſt of fat things: of marrow, and of wines, well refined Iſa.</hi> 25. <hi>v.</hi> 6. O this mount is Chriſt, and the feaſt, Gods diſcovery to a Saint in Chriſt: this feaſt is ſweet, yea ſweeter then honey, or the honey-combe, though it comes far ſhort of that which God ſhall make for the Lamb, and the Lambs wife. <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.9. Which is called <hi>the Lambs ſupper,</hi> of which it is ſaid, bleſſed are all they that are called to it; yea, bleſſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that ever they were borne to come to this Supper.</p>
               <p>O this God and Chriſt, familiar preſence with you will be a feaſt and ſupper to you: here is Chriſt the tree of life, and God the river of life, eat and drink abundantly, yea, I mean now, O precious chriſtian, by beleeving what is a comming.</p>
               <p>O, I would a poore Saint ſhould feaſt his ſoul with expectation of what Chriſt hath promiſed, and will then make good in that day, when they ſhall ſit in his throne, and feed at his table, and drink of his wine, at this feaſt of Gods own ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king for his ſons and daughters now married to Chriſt, and brought to his preſence, to live in his ſight, and feaſt at his table.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid, when the King ſits at his table his <hi>Spiknard</hi> ſends forth a fragrant ſmell, as in <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> ſongs: This is ſpoken of Chriſt ſitting in a Saints heart.</p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:171624:15"/>
               <p> O but what a ſmell ſhall there be then, when a Saint ſhall ſit (as I may ſo ſay) in God and Chriſts heart at ſupper in their loves, by feeding on divine delights.</p>
               <p>O friends this is the ſweet <hi>Manna</hi> that Chriſt promiſed to feed his Saints with. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.17. Chriſt tels his diſciples, <hi>he will drink no more of the fruit of the vine: till he drink it new in his fathers kingdome with them:</hi> the Vine was a tipe of Chriſts blood, and Chriſts blood a type of Chriſts love, and Chriſts love a merit and manifeſtation of the Fathers love, when ye come to ſit down in the glory of God and Chriſt: full cups of this ſhall go round from Saint to Saint.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, this ſitting down in Chriſts kingdom or throne, and Gods glory it denotes familiarity, we uſually bid friends ſit down to enterchange diſcourſe with them.</p>
               <p>O friends in that day, God will tell thee over and over againe his tranſactions in reſpect of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree and purpoſe: O when God ſhall tel thee, how he rould thee in his thoughts, and carried thee in his purpoſe, and had thee in his eye, intending thee for glory: it is ſweet to think how Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light was with the ſons of men before the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the world, as himſelf ſpeaketh <hi>Pro.</hi> 8. and then in that day ſhall Chriſt tell thee over his travels, troubles, and pains too, for thee his Spouſe.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid in a fabliſh ſtory, that <hi>Dido</hi> the queen wept when <hi>Aeneas,</hi> prince of <hi>Troy,</hi> cold
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:171624:15"/>her of his ten yeares wars. I will not ſay thou ſhalt weep when thy deare Saviour ſhall tell thee theſe true things: but I dare ſay, thy ſoule ſhall even melt, (as it were) to think what paines and labour, what care and coſt, what griefe and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, thy ſoule did coſt thy dear Saviour: beſides the ſlights, and ſcornes, and jeares which the vileſt of men did caſt upon him, which he contentedly did beare for thee from day to day his whole life long.</p>
               <p>And then at laſt, ſtill for thy ſake, his back, his belly, his hands, his feet, his head, his ſide, his heart; his heart blood too, and all for thee, that thou mighteſt know how much he loved thee.</p>
               <p>O friends, I am perſwaded that Chriſt will in that day tell you over and over ſuch true ſtories, that it ſhall even melt you hearts and ſoules to thinke how much he loved you, how deare he bought you: but then Chriſt ſhall ask his Saints what they ſuffered for him, to which they will anſwer, O ſweet Jeſus, why doſt thou ask us this queſtion, ſeeing thou knoweſt all our ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings were but fleabites to thine, thine, O deare Saviour: the moſt we ſuffered was but jears, and ſcorns, and ſuch ſlight things; nay, my children, ye were whipp'd, and ſtripp'd, and killed too for mee, my ſake; O Chriſt doe not ſpeake of that, were it to do again, ten thouſand lives ſhould not be deare for thee, thy ſake O deareſt Chriſt, to whom our ſoules are ſo engaged.</p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:171624:16"/>
               <p> O Chriſt, we now Wiſh we had done when time was, and ſufferd ten thouſand times more then we did: O Chriſt, it even now grieves us to think we never did, nor ſuffered any thing for thy ſake to any purpoſe. O Chriſt, that we had now an opportunity to ſhow our love as once we had, for ſquibs and ſcorns, for ſtripes and priſons we would not ſtand, nor yet our lives, nay, ſouls and all to honour thee. O ſweet, O dear, O pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Chriſt: and then Chriſt being taken as it were with theſe expreſſions of his Spouſe ſhall ſtroke her, ſaying, <hi>O my love, my dove, my dear,</hi> thou ſufferedſt enough to teſtifie thy love to me.</p>
               <p>But now, <hi>my love, my dove,</hi> the winter is over, all ſtormes paſt, ſinging, rejoycing is now at hand, come along, come along <hi>my love,</hi> from <hi>Lebon,</hi> come let us to my fathers <hi>wine-ſeller:</hi> who ſhall then ſay, bring them in, and ſet them down in my throne and glory, they are my ſons and daughters.</p>
               <p>Friends, what a privilidge will this be to ſit by God and Chriſt in glory, like children round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a fathers table.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mary</hi> once ſate at Chriſts feet pondering Chriſts ſayings, and it was a great privilidge for a ſinner to ſit ſo neer a Saviour: but thy privilidge is farre greater, who ſhalt ſit by God and this Saviour, who is, far aſcended above all principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and power, and is ſet down in glory on the right hand of God, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks.</p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:171624:16"/>
               <p> This is a greater privilidge then <hi>Marys,</hi> bearing Chriſt, (barely conſidered;) the diſciples had a great priviledge to wait on Chriſt: a greater to ſup, and dine with Chriſt: but what are all to the ſitting downe with Chriſt, in the throne of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid, <hi>John</hi> leaned on the boſome of Chriſt, O loving <hi>John!</hi> O loving Chriſt! to give ſuch priviledge to a bold, but loving, ſweet, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſinner: <hi>John, John,</hi> how couldeſt thou be ſo bold with Chriſt thy Lord and Maſter? <hi>John,</hi> twas love within that boſome that drawed thee there to reſt, and loll as in a lap, it was love that drawed thee, it was loue that laid thee in that ſame boſome: but yet I ſay, thy privilege far excels in ſitting down with Chriſt in the throne of Chriſt, Chriſt was in the form of a ſervant, now Lord of all things: Chriſt was then, I ſay, on earth with a mean out-ſide round about him, but now ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with Angels with his title on his thigh, King of kings, Lord of lords.</p>
               <p>Chriſt was then in rags but now cloathed with ſuns and ſtars, Chriſt was then God-man, unglorified, but now glorified of God with that eternall glory of God which Chriſt had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world was, as Chriſt ſpeaks, <hi>John.</hi> 17.</p>
               <p>O friends, this glory like gliſtering diamonds, ſparkles round the heavens, dazeling Saints and Angels. Well friend, is not thy privilidge farre above <hi>Johns,</hi> to ſit down with this Chriſt in
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:171624:17"/>his throne and glory, ſide by ſide, as I may ſo ſay.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, this ſitting downe in the throne of Chriſt, and the glory of God, denotes honour; what an honour is it for a beggar to ſit at a Kings table, you will ſay, that is a great honour indeed: but what is that to thine, O gentle ſinner? to ſit with God and Chriſt in glory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seemes it a ſmall thing,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, to be a Kings ſon in law?</hi> O but ye are the King of kings ſons and daughters, ye are the Bride, the Lambs wife. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21 9. Come ſaith the Angel, <hi>I will ſhew thee the Bride, the Lambs wife,</hi> nothing draws the eyes of the people to gaze more, then the ſight of the Bride and the Bridegroom. Was the queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> ſo taken with <hi>Solomons</hi> glory, that ſhe cried out, O happy are theſe that tend thee, <hi>O Solomon:</hi> Angels and Archangels will be taken with thy glory, when this marriage ſhall be ſolemnized before the Father.</p>
               <p>It was a queſtion once. <hi>What ſhall be done to the man whom the King will honour, and delight in:</hi> But I ask, what ſhall be done to the man whom the King of kings delighteth to honour; firſt, <hi>he ſhall be arayed in pure white linnen, which is the rigteouſneſſe of the Saints,</hi> as in <hi>Revel. He ſhall be cloathed with the Sun, and trample the Moon under his feet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I know, the Saints ſhining forth in Chriſt are able in ſome meaſure to trample theſe changeable things, by living farre above them, in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable

               <p>Chriſt ſayes, <hi>John</hi> 17. <hi>The glory thou haſt gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me, I have given them, that we may be one, O Father.</hi> One part of Chriſts glory is this, that the Father hath appointed the Son to judge the world, and in this reſpect Chriſt will honour his Saints; know ye not, ſaith <hi>Paul, that the ſaints ſhall judge Angels and men:</hi> here they look like poor ſhrimps, as they are cloathed with rags and fleſh: but when Chriſt ſhall appear, then ſhall we appear with him in glory, as the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſpeaketh.</p>
               <p>O this appearance ſhall confound the world, as ſoon as Chriſt hath confounded the world, with his own, and his Saints glorious appearing to the world; then ſhall he ſit downe in glory, to reſt himſelfe as it were ſatisfied in the finiſhments of all his works, and the Saints ſhall ſit down by Chriſt, as well pleaſed with Chriſt and all his works, what an honour is this? Well, this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour all his Saints ſhall have, <hi>Thy name O Lord it above the heavens,</hi> ſaith <hi>David;</hi> and as his name,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:171624:18"/>ſo his Saints too, in ſeating them above Angels, as taken into union with Chriſt, and ſet down in the Throne of Chriſt: What joy, feaſting, muſick, is there at your Princes marriage dayes when ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized? O but when the Bridegroome, and his Spouſe the Bride, &amp; the Lambs Wife ſhall ſit down to ſolemnize that eternall match, made up in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting purpoſe and counſell of God the Father, long before all worlds, or the Foundations of them: O what ſongs then? what joy? what prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſhall Angels ſing with lightſome hearts? Yea, I ſay Angels, and this too ſhall they count their heaven and happineſſe: O thou melancholy Saint, toſſed with afflictions, what thinkſt thou of this day? tell me, tell me true; ſure thou doſt not mind this, if thou didſt, thou couldſt never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of wants &amp; loſſes; if thou didſt mind this day indeed, this endleſſe day, when heaven ſhall ring with ſhouts and praiſes unto the Lord, and unto the Lambe, by Saints and Angels as with one voice.</p>
               <p>Doth a little Inſtrument ſweetly touchd, take and charme the eare, and Siren-like, kill all other delights, at leaſt, for preſent? O how ſhall thy ſoul be taken? yea, taken and charmed to heare the Songs of praiſes unto the Lord, unto the Lambe, in that ſame day unto the Lord; O that muſt needs have a ſweet melodie in it, which muſt touch and take that eare, which made that eare by which weheare.</p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:171624:18"/>
               <p> If all the skilfulleſt Muſitions in the world ſhould meet, with every one the ſweeteſt Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that could be thought on, with all <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> Singers, yea, and ten thouſand more to them; I ſay, if all theſe ſhould meet to try their skill, and ſtraine their voyces, yet would the Songs, the Praiſes of one bare Saint, or Angel, as farre excell them all for ſweetneſſe, as they excell the Aſſes braying; and if ſo, what ſweetneſſe will there be when ten thouſand times ten chouſands of Saints, with as many Angels, ſhall all joyne as with one voice, to ſing their praiſes unto the Lamb; O Chriſt, how bleſſed is that ſoule whom thou wilt to ſit in thy Throne to hear theſe Songs, to heare theſe praiſes.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, This ſitting down in the Throne of Chriſt, and the Glory of God, denotes joy and triumph: It is ſaid, at <hi>Chriſts birth, Angels and innumerable company of Angels was heard to ſing and rejoyce,</hi> Luke 2.13. <hi>Glory to God on high, peace and good will to men on Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Shall not this Song be ſung again at that day, when Chriſts marriage ſhall be ſolemnized, a match of the Fathers own making?

               </p>
               <p>O friend, this <hi>David</hi> was a tipe of our <hi>David,</hi> our Chriſt, who hath foyld and ſlaine all for his <hi>Iſrael; Let her therefore be glad and rejoyce in God her Saviour, yea, let her rejoyce now with Timbrell and Harp, let the high praiſes be had in their mouthes, and let them ſing aloud his praiſes, who hath now redeemed them from off the earth, out of every kindred, tongues, and nations, a people for his praiſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O <hi>Iſrael,</hi> created for his praiſes, praiſe thou the Lord; O <hi>Jacob,</hi> formed of God, praiſe thou the Lord: O all ye Saints of his, praiſe him day and night; O all ye Angels, Archangels, Cherubims, and Seraphims praiſe ye the Lord, for he hath magnified you.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, this ſitting down in the throne of Chriſt, or Gods glory, denotes abiding; we bid friends ſit down when we would have them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide With us: ſo by this ſitting in the throne of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:171624:19"/>Chriſt, it denotes, that Chriſt is willing thou ſhouldeſt abide, and ſit with him for ever. I remember <hi>Peter,</hi> having but a glimps of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> glory in the mount, ſaith thus to Chriſt: O Maſter, let us build here Tabernacles: marke <hi>Peters</hi> deſire was ſure to live and die here.</p>
               <p>O precious Chriſtian, thou ſhalt live and never die in this mount <hi>Sion,</hi> where thou ſhalt ſee <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> again; yea ten thouſand times ten thouſand glorious Saints, as well as with as many Angels, and God, and Chriſt, excelling all ten thouſand times over and over again: now <hi>Peter,</hi> how much better will this be then thy wiſh, to ſit down in the glory of this God, and throne of Chriſt. One thing, ſaith <hi>David,</hi> I have deſired of the Lord, <hi>That I might dwell all the dayes of my life in thy houſe, to behold the beauty of thy tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:</hi> this is the wiſh of every gracious heart as well as <hi>Davids:</hi> but here is more promiſed, far more then this wiſh: namely, an abiding, not onely in the houſe of God, but a ſitting in the glory of God, with Chriſt, where thou ſhalt ſit time, time out of minde. Chriſt will never bid that ſoul ſit up, whom he once ſets down in his throne.</p>
               <p>Chriſt tels his Diſciples, <hi>becauſe I live, ye ſhall live alſo. John.</hi> 17. As if Chriſt ſhould have ſaid, I cannot live without you: and whilſt I have a throne, I muſt have your company.</p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:171624:20"/>
               <p> O chriſtian, wert thou to be in heaven a few mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, it would be a reward ſufficient for all thou didſt, or ever ſufferedſt for Chriſt. O happy chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, thou ſhalt ſit, not onely moments, but dayes, moneths, nay years, nay ages, yea more then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, as much longer then ages: as all ages are longer then one moment, one bare moment, time ſhall be no more, nor ſin be no more, nor ſorrow ſhall be no more but thou ſhalt remain, and be for ever with Chriſt in the throne of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>O ſaith <hi>Daniel, his Kingdome is an everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting Kingdome:</hi> ſo may I ſay, his throne is an everlaſting throne, <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Though the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens be changed, and rouled up like a ſcrowle, yet thou remaineſt the ſame:</hi> ſo may I ſay of this throne: O happy chriſtian, Princes would thinke themſelves happy, might they but ſit but a few days more then ordinary in their thrones to reign in glory.</p>
               <p>O friends, Chriſt ſaith, <hi>He that overcommeth ſhall ſit with me in my throne, as I have overcome, and am ſet with my Father in his throne;</hi> ſo that thou ſhalt ſit with Chriſt, and reigne, as it were, within the eternity of Chriſt. O eternity, O eternity, when I think on thee, how is times and worlds ſwallowed up, and loſt like little ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in the ocean? how are joyes, griefs, and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes ſwallowed up by thee, O Eternity, like little fiſhes by the whales? here one age paſſeth,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:171624:20"/>and another commeth, all mouldering into eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, like fleſh to duſt, <hi>here, ſaith Paul, we have noe abiding city: but we have one to come,</hi> aluding to what Chriſt hath promiſed. O that can never be ſhaken: all things here, are, and muſt be ſhaken, yea, the earth, and heavens, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh, We ſee it, we ſee it, how are all earthly <hi>Monarchs</hi> ſhaken now in our dayes. O me thinks Chriſt is now a ſhaking all powers in the world, do not you ſee it, nay, do not you ſee them fall like our ripe fruit; truely, me thinks I ſee Chriſt hewing down Kings and Princes with a voice as loud as thunder, crying, room, room, for my ſelfe, and my Goſpel: O how have theſe kingdomes been ſhaking, and the mighty men overturned: over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned by the voice which is ſtill abroad thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring, that the world round about may heare and make room for Chriſt, and his Goſpel, and all that will embrace it: but the heavens muſt be ſhaken, the heavens that cover this earth, and the heavens that covers Gods glory, the glory of his free grace in Jeſus Chriſt: I mean, mans righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, that is now a ſhaking by the Spirit of the Lord, by proclaiming Chriſt, and his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſueſſe to the worſt of ſinners.</p>
               <p>Men have thought, by way of works, to find life and ſalvation, neglecting Chriſt, at leaſt in part, by reſting, as it were, on two propes, Chriſt, and their own works: but know this, Chriſt is
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:171624:21"/>all, and now will be all or nothing at all; your former Popiſh ignorance he winked at, but now he wills that all men repent of this ſinne, ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceitedneſſe. O! Chriſt muſt be all in all, but I ſhall ſtep a little aſide; the thing I aime at, is to tell you, what that is that remaines, and cannot, nor ſhall ever be ſhaken by men, or devils; well heaven and earth muſt be, but theſe two things cannot be.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The righteouſneſſe of Chriſt in which he clothes ſinners, yea, the worſt of ſinners that comes to him, and makes them Saints. O ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, ſinner, come to Chriſt, honour him by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and he will honour thee, by giving his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe unto thee; O this righteouſneſſe is the long white Robe in which all the Saints are clothed, <hi>Revelations.</hi> Sinner, come and take this Robe, come, yee may have it, come, it is free, yee may have it, come, it is free to all, yea, free to all that will accept it: O come then, come ſinners, all ſorts of ſinners, high, low, rich, poore, young, old, bound, free; but if yee do not come, then remember this, I ſay, remember this, yee ſhall cry one day to the rocks and mountaines to fall on you, and runne to the dennes and caves to hide your naked ſoules, naked for want of Chriſts righteouſneſs which yee once refuſed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As the righteouſneſs of Chriſt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſhaken, ſo the throne of Chriſt cannot be
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:171624:21"/>ſhaken: <hi>Daniel</hi> ſaith, <hi>His Kingdome is an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Kingdome, and his Throne is an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Throne, and is eſtabliſhed for ever,</hi> ſaith <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid.</hi> Well, he that overcomes by Chriſt, ſhall ſit by Chriſt in this Throne. How we overcome I tould you at firſt, namely, by Chriſt the Captaine of our ſalvation, an eaſie way for thee: well, O ſinner, reſolve, reſolve thy ſelfe what thou wilt doe. For ſurely there are two eternities that all muſt paſſe into; one with Chriſt in the Throne of Chriſt; and of this eternity and glory, all this that hath beene ſpoken, is but as one Grape of that Bunch which the Spies brought from <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> for <hi>Iſrael</hi> to taſte in her journey; you, who are traveling with your faces <hi>Zion</hi> ward, taſte if there be not a ſweetneſſe in this one Grape, this one Promiſe of Chriſt, in ſitting down with Chriſt in the Throne and Glory of Chriſt: but as for thy reſolution I know it, I know it very well; thou art reſolved to live more and more to Chriſt, and the honour of Chriſt, who will thus honour thee, by ſeating thee on his own Throne: but for thy reſolution, I faine would have. yea, thine O careleſſe ſinner, and if it be not for Chriſt, and the honour of Chriſt, mark me well what I ſay; thy eternity ſhall not be with Chriſt, no, nor the Saints of Chriſt, but quite contrary with Devils, <hi>Zim,</hi> and <hi>Ohim,</hi> and damned ſpirits in dreadfull flames and utter darkneſſe: but I hope thou wilt
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:171624:22"/>be wiſe, and change thy reſolution, or elſe, O all that love thee, mourne, mourne, mourne for thee.</p>

               <p>And now in the 1. verſe of this chap. he ſaw a new repreſentation of all things, <hi>as a new Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and a new earth,</hi> and of this <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeaks chap. 66. v. 22. and chap. 65. v. 17. and here again. Rev. 21. <hi>I ſaw a new heaven, and a new

               </p>
               <p>From whence obſerve briefly, that God makes his divine, and glorious diſcoveries to ſome ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular men, to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to <hi>Moſes,</hi> to <hi>Iacob,</hi> to <hi>Daniel,</hi> to a <hi>Paul,</hi> to a <hi>Iohn,</hi> as in theſe words.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I <hi>Iohn ſaw the holy city too,</hi> he ſaw many glorious things, and this city amongſt the reſt.</p>
               <p>From whence obſerve, where God makes one divine diſcovery, he will go on to make more and more ſtill, till at laſt he ſhewes them his own face, and glory, <hi>and they ſhall ſee my face,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>Revel.</hi> 22. verſe 4.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I <hi>Iohn ſaw,</hi> how didſt thou ſee? by a divine diſcovery of Chriſt, O all diſcoveries of this nature, are from Chriſt and the Spirit: but when was this diſcovery to him? on the Lords day, as chap. 1. v. 10. on the Lords day, that is, on that day, when the Lord Chriſt took <hi>Iohn</hi> up in a trance, to ſhew him all thoſe glorious things, which he ſaith, <hi>Bleſſed are they that read, or hear theſe things.</hi> I, bleſſed are they indeed, that ever
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:171624:23"/>they were born, whoſe eyes and eares Chriſt hath ſo opened, as to ſee, and underſtand the miſterie herein, which the blind bats, and carnall world, neither doe, nor can ſee, till God enlighten them by his Spirit.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>I Iohn ſaw the holy city, new Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeaks chap. 64.16: of <hi>a holy city, which lay waſt. v.</hi> 26. <hi>of a city which had ſalvation for wals and bulwarks.</hi> But briefly, the holy city <hi>Iohn</hi> ſpeaks of here, is that new <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> of which old <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> was but a type, and yet that <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> which was but a type of this city, was the glory of the whole world, the only city in the world, yea called the city of the great King.</p>
               <p>For firſt, it was the figure of the everlaſting city of God, and therefore called <hi>Salem,</hi> a place of peace, wherein the Prieſts of God reigned; it was ſetled on four mountaines, mount <hi>Sion,</hi> mount <hi>Moriah,</hi> the two chief: on mount <hi>Sion, Dauids</hi> houſe ſtood, and it was called mount <hi>Sion,</hi> becauſe it was a type of the higheſt heaven, or habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Almighty God, from which throne, or habitation, he deſcended in Chriſt to this lower <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and became our Redeemer, to bring us into the higheſt Mount, his eternall glory in mount <hi>Sion</hi> the higheſt heavens.</p>
               <p>And now for mount <hi>Moriah,</hi> it is as much to ſay, the Lords mirrhe, as miniſters do interpret, which ſignifieth our Lord Chriſt, which is the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:171624:23"/>true mirrhe, and a ſweet ſmelling ſacrifice unto God, yea a ſtedfaſt rock, and unmoveable foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, whereon Gods Church, and Chriſts mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are all built, as on a ſure foundation, as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 28. and <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. <hi>On this rock I will build my Church,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, meaning himſelf, <hi>and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the gates of hell ſhall never prevail againſt it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides, this city had many mountaines round about it, mount <hi>Olivet</hi> was one, to which Chriſt went many times to pray and meditate, <hi>David</hi> ſaith, in one of his <hi>Pſalmes; as the mountaines are round about Ieruſalem, ſo the Lord is round about his people,</hi> and in Ieruſalem was <hi>Davids</hi> houſe, which ſtood on mount <hi>Sion,</hi> as I ſaid before, mount <hi>Sion</hi> was a great mount in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> on which <hi>David</hi> built, typing out the Saints ſafety, who are built on Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, in <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> was <hi>Solomons</hi> temple, which the Iewes told Chriſt was fourty yeares a building, and this temple was indeed the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious piece in the whole world, for workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and riches, and in this temple was all the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, the <hi>Ark</hi> and the <hi>Covenant,</hi> the <hi>Mercy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeat,</hi> and the <hi>Manna,</hi> the <hi>Arke</hi> of God was made of <hi>Shittim-wood,</hi> which like the <hi>Olivet,</hi> and the <hi>Cipreſſe,</hi> are not ſubject to wormes, and putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, which did typefie the humane nature of Chriſt, which <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. <hi>Thou wilt not ſuffer to ſee corruption.</hi> And in this <hi>Ark</hi> of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:171624:24"/>
                  <hi>Shittim</hi> was kept, or laid up by Gods appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the golden pot of <hi>Manna, Aarons</hi> rod, and the two tables of commandements, as <hi>Exod.</hi> 25. and <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9. And for the golden pot of <hi>Manna,</hi> it was a clear type of Chriſt, who is the true <hi>Manna,</hi> and <hi>the bread that came downe from heaven, to give life to the world,</hi> as himſelfe ſpeaketh. <hi>John</hi> 6. <hi>I am the bread of life,</hi> ſaith Chriſt to the Jewes.</p>
               <p>And for <hi>Aarons</hi> Rod that lay in this Arke of <hi>Shittim</hi> wood, its bloſomes did ſignifie, the ſweetneſſe of the Goſpel, and the Glory of Chriſt, and the fruitfulneſſe of his Members, who bud and bloſome continually by his renewing grace.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, To this City the Tribes and all the People of God, reſorted at ſet times to worſhip, and all the world to trade and trafique; it had twelve Gates, which were not to be ſhut day nor night; which <hi>John</hi> alludes to in the 12. <hi>verſe</hi> of this <hi>chapter, Glorious things are ſpoken of this City; on the wals of this City,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>have I ſet watchmen, which ſhall never keep ſilence, till</hi> Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem <hi>be made the praiſe of the whole earth;</hi> this is the city which <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>If I forget thee, then let my right hand for get its cunning;</hi> which was his muſicall skill, by which he charmed the Devill in <hi>Saul</hi> many a time.</p>
               <p>And this was that city too, which melted the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:171624:24"/>heart of Chriſt to think of its ruine, ſaying, <hi>O Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem,</hi> with rouling bowels, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ights, and teares, <hi>O that thou hadſt knowne in this thy day, the things that make for thy peace, which now are hid from thine eyes. For this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſake,</hi> ſaith <hi>Iſaiah, will I not hold my tongue, till</hi> Sion <hi>and</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>be made the glory and praiſe of the whole Earth.</hi> I ſhall ſpeake no more of old <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> the Type, but of this new <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> which is the Church and People of God.</p>
               <p>But why is the Church of God called by the name of a City.</p>
               <p>For three, or four reaſons, which I will breifly hint at. 1. It is compared to a city for numerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the variety of this numeration. 2. The Church of God is called a city, for her viſibility, for ſhe is not like a candle under a buſhell, but like a beakon on a hill. 3. The Church of God may be called a city, for her treaſure and riches. 4. It may be called a city, for her peculiar priviledges, which the Church of God hath from all the world; like a city from your country townes and villages. 5. In reſpect of her rivers, your cities are fed and refreſhed by ſome great river; <hi>There is a river that the ſtreames thereof ſhall refreſh the City of God,</hi> Pſal. 46. <hi>verſ.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>And firſt, Whereas it is compared to a city, it denotes, the Church of God are a great and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſſe people, as you cannot number the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:171624:25"/>of a city, no more, nor leſſe; indeed, can yee number the Church of God: O ſaith God to <hi>Abraham, In bleſſing, I will bleſſe thee, and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply thee as the Starres in Heaven, or the ſands on the Sea ſhore, ſo that if thou canſt number them, then ſhall thy ſeed be numbered. Many ſhall come,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>from the Eaſt, and from the Weſt, and ſhall ſit down with</hi> Abraham, I ſack <hi>and</hi> Jacob <hi>in the Kingdome of God.</hi> Here is the variety of the Church, ſome comming in, from the Eaſt, and ſome from the Weſt, which is the moſt remote place that can be, and implies them to bee the greateſt ſinners for Idolatry and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſme; yet ſaith Chriſt, <hi>many of theſe ſhall come from both places,</hi> which denotes variety. O the long wayes, out wayes, by wayes, and many wayes, that Chriſt brings ſinners to this <hi>City,</hi> or <hi>Fould;</hi> which <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſpeakes of to the <hi>Jewes,</hi> ſaying, <hi>I have other Sheep, which I muſt bring into my Fould, when they ſhall he are my voyce, or whiſtle, by my Spirit in their ſouls, and ſo there ſhall be one ſheep, and one fould,</hi> Chriſt commands, and commiſſionates his diſciples, to go and preach the Goſpell to every nation, tongue, and people; and therefore ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> Iew and Gentile, bond, or free, Scithian or Barbarian, Chriſt is all, and in all, he hath all in his fould, and ſo he is all to them.</p>
               <p>And as he hath great number of theſe varieties,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:171624:25"/>ſo his church may well be called a numberleſſe people, and therefore ſaith <hi>Iohn, I ſaw with the Lamb ſtanding, an hundred forty and four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, beſides a great number, which no tongue could tell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well, let us, who were remote ſinners, not onely in reſpect of nature and gentiliſme: but in reſpect of parentage, and families brought into the church of Chriſt; one from popery, and popiſh ignorance, another from a curſed, drunken, and helliſh family, where God, it may be, never ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into one ſoul, before he did into thine; which mercy cals for as much thankfulneſſe at your hands, as ever <hi>Noahs, Abrahams, Lots, Daniels.</hi> O, for God to appear to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a covenant of life and peace, and to ſingle out <hi>Noah</hi> from the whole world, and lead out <hi>Lot,</hi> yea catch, and carry out the lingering man to a <hi>Zoar,</hi> and leave the reſt for fire and brimſtone, did argue abundantly free grace.</p>
               <p>Well friend, doe not thou neglect to bleſſe God, whilſt thou haſt any beeing, for doing the like to thy ſoul, by chuſing and pulling thee out of ſinne, nature, death, and hell. O ſaith <hi>Paul, I have obtained mercy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, ſhe may be compared to a city, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of her viſibility, ſhe is not like a candle un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a buſhel, but as a fire, a beacon on a hill, your cities are ſpacious to the eye, and ſo is the Church,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:171624:26"/>and ſhall be more and more: for Chriſt now by his providence ſeemes to ſay, <hi>ariſe, and ſhine, and ſhake thy ſelf from the duſt, O captive daughter of Sion,</hi> ſhew thy ſelf, and let the nations know thy ſtrength, power, glory, and greatneſſe, that they may be in love with thee, and come in, fall down, and bow their neckes to thy ſweet yoaks of obedience to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the church of God is compared to a city for her treaſure, you know all the treaſures of God are laid up in Chriſt, as a ſtore houſe to this city, and every citizen hath, as I may ſo ſay, is the key of this ſtorehouſe, by which he goeth and fetcheth out what treaſure he will, I mean the Spirit, by which they may fetch out pardon, peace, righteouſneſſe, yea, any thing they need: but ſtill by the Spirit, which <hi>is the key of David, that ſhuts and no man opens, that opens and no man ſhuts,</hi> this Spirit ſaith Chriſt to his diſciples, <hi>ſhall take of mine, and ſhew it unto you,</hi> as <hi>Iohn</hi> 10.</p>
               <p>And this he doth to the whole church of God, and truely, you that know the Spirit, knows, he brings rich and coſtly things to your ſouls many times; ſometime pardon for ſinne, and them free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly too, which could not be bought out by tears and ſorrows before he comes.</p>
               <p>O ſaith the Spirit, I have brought thee that, for which thou weepeſt, and mourneſt, namely, a pardon ſealed in Chriſts blood, and a crowne to
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:171624:26"/>purchaſt by Chriſts merits. O ſinner, what thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt thou of this pardon, is it not ſweet, yes ſaith the ſinner, ſweeter then the honey, or the hony-combe.</p>
               <p>O ſaith a poore ſoule, I bleſſe God more for this, then if he had made me the greateſt prince in the world.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, it is called a city, for her privilidges; no city, but hath its charter, and privilidges, at leaſt ſome diſtinct from towns and villages.</p>
               <p>O <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> city of our God, thy privilidges excell all the worlds, who may be compared to thee for privilidges, yea, peculiar privilidges; which no nation, but thee, can lay hold on, nor people in the world neither; all the people in the world are Gods by creation, but <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> by purchaſe; all the world he feeds and cloaths.</p>
               <p>O Iſrael, who is a people like unto thee, ſhielded by the great God, fed by the <hi>Manna,</hi> and <hi>watered by the rocks, and ſheltred by a cloud by day, and a pillar of ſire by night.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God in a way of providence, keeps all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but man eſpecially: but <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> above all, who are his choice pieces of ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, yea, his treaſure and jewels; now treaſure, you know, men will keep choicer then that which is but ordinary, parents will let farthings and counters lie about for their children to play with: but who will leave jewels careleſly, here
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:171624:27"/>and there, in common places: no, men are wiſe, and will lay up their precious ſtones in choice cabbenets: and ſo doth God, he layes his up in his cabbenet of providence, and charges his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels with theſe jewels, or ſons of <hi>Sion,</hi> more precious then jewels, or choice ſilver either; and in this particular, he is ſaid to keep them, as a man keepeth the apple of his eye, and is as ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der over them, as a father; ſo ſaith <hi>David as a father pittieth his children, ſo pittieth the Lord them that fear him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O happy, and bleſſed people, pittied, ſaved, and kept by God; I will keep thee every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yea, every moment in the den, yea, every moment in the furnace, and every moment in all houres and ſeaſons, night and day, death, and judgement, in times of troubles, warres, and judgement, yea, cloſſet them; in raines I houſe them, like <hi>Noah</hi> in the Arke, and in famine feed them, like <hi>Eliſha</hi> by the raven; yea, what ſhall I ſay, I will be a pillar of fire by night, and a cloud by day, yea, a ſun and ſhield, as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks, and ſure defence too.</p>
               <p>And now, who art thou that forgetteſt the Lord thy maker, and feareſt the man, or the ſon of man, who is as the graſſe of the field, and ſhall die.</p>
               <p>But in the fifth, and laſt place, the Church is compared to a city; becauſe the Spirit is as a
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:171624:27"/>river feeding of it, O ſaith <hi>David, He feeds me in green paſtures, and leads me by the ſtill wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> this he ſpeaks of concerning the Spirit; if the foundation be removed, what can the righteous do, <hi>There is a river, the ſtreames thereof ſhall make glad the city of God. Pſalm.</hi> 46.4. O this Spirit ſtreaming in, and by thee, preſents Chriſt over and over to thy ſoul in all his lovelineſſe, and this muſt needs make glad the city, a people of God.</p>
               <p>Nothing is the Spirit oftner compared to, then the waters, when the poor and needy ſeeks waters, I the Lord will heare, and open rivers in the tops of the mountains, this is a propheſie of the Spirits powring out to poore, and thirſty, who do apprehend themſelves farre from the water of conſolation, <hi>I will powre out my Spirit</hi> ſaith God, by the prophet <hi>Ioel, and your ſons and your daughters ſhall propheſie,</hi> that is, they ſhall be enabled to open the Scriptures my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries.</p>
               <p>But now, why is it called a holy city.</p>
               <p>The Scripture ſpeaks of a two fold holineſſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt a holineſſe of things.</p>
               <p>Secondly a holineſſe of perſons.</p>
               <p>Firſt, a holineſſe of things in foure or five reſpects.</p>
               <p>Firſt, things are ſaid to be holy, by way of dedication, or conſecration, ſo the bowls of the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:171624:28"/>temple are ſaid to be holy, and all the veſſels of the temple too.</p>
               <p>Secondly, things are ſaid to holy by way of ſimulation, or figure, ſo was the Arke, the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen ſerpent, <hi>Aarous</hi> rod, and the <hi>Manna,</hi> which did figure and ſimilie out Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, things may be ſaid to be holy, by way of calling, ſo was the Prieſts office, it was a holy calling: <hi>be holy, ye that beare the veſſels of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, things may be ſaid to be holy, by way of rule, or precept, ſo the word of God, the law of God is holy, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, though I be ſinfull, <hi>yet the law is holy, and juſt, and good, though I be carnall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, things may be ſaid to be holy, by way of comparation, ſo <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> is called, the holy city, becauſe the holy God was worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in it, though it were in it ſelfe a ſinfull city.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, perſons may be ſaid to be holy likewiſe.</p>
               <p>And firſt, by way of creation, ſo the fallen Angels were made holy, and <hi>Adam</hi> too in his firſt creation, <hi>God created man upright: but he found out many inventions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, perſons may be ſaid to be holy, by way of calling, ſo the Prieſts, Prophets, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and Patriarchs, O ſaith <hi>Paul, the holy men
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:171624:28"/>of God ſpake as they were inſpired by the holy Ghoſt in them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, men may be ſaid to be holy, by the inherent holineſſe of God in them, having the holy Spirit of God in them, purifying of them, and now they may be well ſaid to be holy, in theſe reſpects, firſt comparing themſelves with themſelves, formerly they walked in darkneſſe, and lived in ſin, and nature: but now in light by the Spirit, who tels them they are none of their own: but redeemed of Chriſt, to whom they live, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>if I live, I live to Chriſt, and if I die, I die to Chriſt,</hi> O happy change from ſin and Satan, to God and Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, men may be ſaid to be holy, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring themſelves with others, whoſe lives lies and wallows in all pollution, <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of ſome, <hi>who were drunkards, covetous, filthy, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, ſinners, and ſuch were ſome of you, but now you are waſhed, and cleanſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, and chiefly, men may be ſaid to be holy, by way of imputation, having the holines, or righteouſnes of God imputed to them, <hi>he was made ſin for us who knew no ſin, that we might be the righteouſneſſe of God in him.</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. And in this ſence, the whole church of God is holy, having the holineſſe, or righteouſneſſe of Chriſt imputed to her; and in this ſence, ſhe is ſaid to be holy, even as Chriſt is holy.</p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:171624:29"/>
               <p> But thirdly, why is this <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> called new <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> for three or four reaſons.</p>
               <p>Firſt, in reſpect of creation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in reſpect of declaration.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, in reſpect of reparation.</p>
               <p>Firſt, in reſpect of creation, ſo you call a thing new, that is newly made; what is ſo a building is called new, becauſe it is newly ſet up: in this reſpect <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> is called new <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> becauſe God hath ſet it up for a building for himſelfe, or habitation for his owne glory, where he will dwell for ever, as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks in another caſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, a thing may be ſaid to be new, in reſpect of reparation.</p>
               <p>God dwels with his people. O when God ſhall new polliſh his temple, and repaire all the wants of his people, may he not then be ſaid, to new make his temple: yea, his preſence with them, is the glory of them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> may be ſaid, to be new, comparatively, comparing it with old <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> that was defiled; this waſhed, that decay'd and withered, this freſh and lovely, even as Bride.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> may be ſaid, to be new, in reſpect of the manifeſtation God gave to <hi>John,</hi> he never ſaw this new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> till now, old <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> hee had ſeene againe, and againe,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:171624:29"/>but this new and lovely City he never ſaw be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and therefore it was new to him, for he had never till now the full diſcovery of it; I ſhall wind up theſe former lines by a word, or two, to what I apprehend, and have ſaid of this City, this holy City, new <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> which <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaw comming down from God.</p>
               <p>But ſome may ſay, your lines would have been more advantages to the Saints and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God, if they had beene on ſome practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call point.</p>
               <p>O chriſtian, precious Chriſtian, let me tell thee, nothing in the world doth more divinely fire the ſpirits of holy Soules, then a ſpirituall diſcourſe of the holy God, and the holy City; O did the Earthly chriſtian but minde this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> how would his low and baſe affections looſen from the creatures pleaſures and profits hear below; or did the ignorant chriſtian but know this holy City, new <hi>Iera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> how ſweetly would this knowledge feed his ſoule, if he did indeed, divinely know this <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> his ſoule would feed on this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, yea, it would feed his ſoul as with mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and fatneſſe.</p>
               <p>And if the fainting chriſtian did but minde this holy City, and his eternall reſt in it, how would hee pluck up his ſpirits; this would be like the hony that <hi>Ionathan</hi> licked on, which
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:171624:30"/>did ſo much revive his ſpirits.</p>
               <p>O the knowledge of this holy City new <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> it would make the blind chriſtian ſee, yea, ſee and ſay, <hi>O Ieruſalem, Ieruſalem, the holy City, the City of the great King, who may be compared with thee, for the glory of the Lord is in thee, the glory of the Lord is on thee, thy Sun ſhall never ſet, thy day ſhall never end, thy ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows ſhall be no more, thy joy ſhall be for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now come yee lame chriſtian and leap for joy, for the Tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they ſhall be his people, and God himſelfe will be their God, and dwell with them, and by dwelling with them, wipe away all teares from their eyes, ſo as they ſhall never ſorrow more, and death ſhall be no more, for the fountaine of life ſhall live with them; nay, with them, doe I ſay, it ſhall live in them, and they ſhall live in it, and by it, and to it for ever and ever, wherefore leap and dance, O thou lame ſoul.</p>
               <p>Truly friends, I know no portion in Gods Word like this and that which followes, which I ſhall point at by Gods aſſiſtance, to raiſe and cheare chriſtians, all ſorts of chriſtians, blind chriſtians, deafe and dumb chriſtians.</p>
               <p>O but how do you call chriſtians, deaf, blind, and dumbe? how? well enough, if they doe not heare with joy theſe things, I think they are
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:171624:30"/>deafe; and if they doe not ſee with an eye of pleaſure, with an eye of joy theſe things, are they not blind? I am ſure they are little better; and if they doe not ſing for joy, are they not dumb? O chriſtian, I ſay, thou art dumb, if thou do not come away and ſing: O but what ſhall I ſing, and how ſhall I ſing? O <hi>Ieruſalem; Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> thy warfare is accompliſhed, thy ſorrowes are over, thy enemies dead, thy God, and thy Father, thy Husband, thy Chriſt is alive, and he lives for ever, for ever for thee, for ever with thee, for ever to thee; let this be thy Song and the burden of it, free grace, free grace, be ſure of that: but now not knowing but ſome uncleane wretch may read theſe ſweet lines, who lives, loves, and wallowes in his ſinnes; I ſhall not ſpeake many words, but one word I would ſpeak to ſuch a one; O poore ſoule, goe and weep, weep, weep ſeas, if it be poſſible, that thou ſhouldſt be ſtill in thy filth, thy blood, and thy ſinnes.</p>
               <p>O poore and unhappy man, as ſure as the Lord lives, if thou be not waſhed by Chriſts blood, faith and repentance, thou wilt be ſhut out of this city, amongſt Dogs, Sorſerers, and Whoremongers, and Lyers, which thou mayeſt thinke mee harſh for telling of thee, but read I pray, and conſider, <hi>Revel.</hi> 22.15. and there it is written with a Pen of Iron what I ſay, which
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:171624:31"/>thou wilt one day finde the truth of it; and then, what wilt thou then doe? but mourne, mourne bitterly, mourne becauſe thou didſt not when time was, mourne for thy ſinnes, but pleaſe thy ſelfe with a bare name of a chriſtian, when indeed thou wert in thy heart an enemy to Chriſt and his people.</p>
               <p>But fiftly, It is called new <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſo farre tranſcends old <hi>Ieruſalem:</hi> I ſhall hint ſomething breifly. 1. In reſpect of her Foundation. 2 In reſpect of her Builders. 3. Her Materials. 4. In reſpect of her Wals and Gates. 5. In reſpect of her Watchmen. 6. Her Glory. 7. Her Light. 8. Her Safety. 9. Her Inhabitants.</p>
               <p>But firſt, For her Foundation, which was but a common Foundation; but thine O new <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> is a choyce and pretious Foundation; Chriſt in thee is the Fonndation of thee.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Old <hi>Ieruſalems</hi> Foundation was a decaying, mouldering Foundation; but thy Foundation, O new <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> is the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion indeed, the ſure Foundation, the laſting Foundation, yea, the outlaſting Foundation, out laſting time and ages, therefore he is called the rock of ages, the rock out laſting ages, all ages and generations paſt and to come.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Ieruſalems</hi> foundation was but a
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:171624:31"/>ſingle foundation; but thine, O new <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> is the foundation of all foundations; twelve foundations are laid upon thee, on which twelve thouſand ſoules have built, yea, twelve thouſand times twelve thouſand, which if they had not, they had been ruind, yea, ſoul and body for ever. O yee unbelieving and fearfull Saints, did you know your rocke and ſafety, if you did, though the winds blow, and ſtormes beat, yet you will not feare.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Thy foundation, O <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> was but of yeſterday, and to day it is raiſed, but the ancient of dayes is thy foundation, O new <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> ſo that thy foundation was for time, before all time paſt, and is, and ſhal be to all time to come, yea, and longer too; the Angel ſwore time ſhould be no more; God hath ſworne by himſelf, that thou ſhouldſt be for ever, the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> above, the mother of us all: and what ſhall I ſay of it? O foundation, foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, of Gods own laying, choiſe and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, ſtrong and ſtable foundation, time and age out laſting foundation, heaven, earth, Saints, and Angels foundation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It might be very well called new <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> if you conſider her builders: old <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> was built by Bricklayers, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters, and ſuch like crafts-men, the choyſeſt of them; but thou, O new <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> by
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:171624:32"/>God, Chriſt and the Spirit; therefore art thou ſaid by <hi>Paul,</hi> to <hi>be made without hands; wee looke for a City whoſe builder and maker is God;</hi> thy Husband is thy maker, the God of the whole earth ſhall he be called, thy God and he onely: none laid one ſtone in thee, but he, none found a ſtone but he, no, nor ſtick, nor ſtraw, as I may ſo ſay, for he found all in his own eternall purpoſe: O, ſaith God, this, and this ſhall be a ſtone to make me a <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> where I will dwell for evermore, but theſe I will not uſe, throwing millions by, which was as likely as any if he had pleaſed to uſe them, to ſet his glory of.</p>
               <p>But as God found all, ſo Chriſt beares all; <hi>We on him are built,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, as a ſpirituall houſe unto the Lord, built by the Spirit;</hi> for as God findes all, and Chriſt bears all, ſo the Spirit builds all, by his Word and Prophets.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> was built for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> nation, but thee, O new <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> for the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who will ſhew his glory in thee, becauſe his love is ſet upon thee, yea, thy very gates more then all the dwellings of <hi>Iacob.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fiftly, Old <hi>Ieruſalems</hi> wals and gates was but common ſtone, but thine, O new <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> are built of all manner of pretious ſtones, yea, thy very gates are pearle, O glorious city, thy
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:171624:32"/>wals, thy gates are precious living ſtones, thy pavements are pure Gold, <hi>Revel.</hi> 21.18.</p>
               <p>O King <hi>Solomon,</hi> where is thy glory? all thy glory was but a dark ſhadow of this glory, O <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> city of the great King, which he hath built for his Jewels, and by his Jewels, and the Sons of <hi>Sion</hi> more pretious then choyſe Silver, to dwell with him, Chriſt and Angels, for ever and ever.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, It is called new <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> in reſpect of her watchmen and keepers; O <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> God did once ſet watchmen on thy wals, but did they keep thee? nay, they could not keep thee, they could not ſave thee, for thou waſt raced even to the ground. But thou, O new <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> hath God and Chriſt within thee, Angels round about thee, well may thy gates be open day and night, <hi>Revelations</hi> the 21. all ſafety is in thee, all protection round about thee, who was wont to be frighted from fears within, and dangers round about.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, in reſpect of her light, thy light O <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> was not to be compared to thine, O new <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> thy light was but ſun, moon, and creatures light: but thy light, O new <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> is this ſun, Suns and glory, Angels are the ſun of thy Sun, and God is the Sun of Angels, and glory too.</p>
               <p>O new <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> the glory of this God in
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:171624:33"/>thee, is the light of thee, the increated glory, the uncreated glory O <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> that is thy light: therefore is thy light, the light of lights, and the light of life too, the glory of the Lord, and of the Lambe in thee, are the light of thee, O <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem;</hi> therefore is thy light, the light of lights, and the light of life too.</p>
               <p>Now thou ſhalt need light of ſun and moon no more, no more for ever; thou moon give place unto the ſun, thou ſun give place unto the Lambe, and unto the Lord; for they muſt ſhine, and ye muſt out for ever: and let them ſhine thy day throughout, thy long and endleſſe day, thy nightleſſe day, thy time and age, out-laſting day. It is ſaid, <hi>Abraham</hi> rejoyced to ſee Chriſts day, O ye ſeed of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> rejoyce in this your day, for it will make amends for all your nights, your nights of ſorrow, fear, and trouble, your longeſt nights, your darkſome, could, and ſtormy ones, yea, <hi>David</hi> tells you ſo, ſaying, <hi>though ſorrow endure for a night, yet joy commeth in the morning.</hi> I, this morning hath a noon of joy in it, this mornings dawning hath: and when ye by its dawning ſee, O then what joy, what peace, what hope, what reſt! thou canſt not tell, but doeſt enjoy thy wiſh, thy would; thy onely wiſh, thy onely would, which when thou haſt, thou ever craveſt; juſt as the child which ſuckes, and cries, and craves, but hath.</p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:171624:33"/>
               <p> Eightly, it is called new <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> in reſpect of her glory, thy glory was gates, walles, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, towers, riches, ſtrength, and numeration of people.</p>
               <p>But for thy glory, O new <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> it doth more excell all this, then ever <hi>Solomons</hi> did the pooreſt <hi>Peſant:</hi> for this read the 60 of Iſa. <hi>Ariſe, and ſhine, for the glory of the Lord is riſen on thee,</hi> the full glorie, the true glorie, which <hi>Moſes could not behold and live, no man can ſee my glory, and live,</hi> ſaith God to <hi>Moſes,</hi> but to thee, O new <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> when darknes ſhal cover the earth, with al the dwellers therein, then ſhall the Lord ariſe upon thee, and his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſhall be ſet, and ſeen on thee, yea, ſuch a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, which ſhall confound the world, yea, confute the world of madnes, and folly, the world hath never ſeen thy glorie, O new <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> but when it doth, ſhame ſhall cover her face, and for ſhame ſhall kings and princes call to the hills, and mountaines to fall upon them. O <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> the Gentiles ſhall walk in thy light, then ſhalt thou ſee, and ſhine, and be aſtoniſhed at thy own glorie, the ſeas ſhall convert her trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and the Gentiles their riches to <hi>Midian; Ephah</hi> and <hi>Sheba, ſhall bring their gold and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe unto thee,</hi> for I will ſaith God, <hi>beautifie the houſe of my glory. verſe</hi> 7. <hi>The yles ſhall waight upon thee, the ſhips of</hi> Tharſhiſh <hi>ſhall

               </p>
               <p>And; whereas thou haſt been deſpiſed, ſo that men went by thee, I will make thee an eternall glory, and a joy from generation to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, and thou ſhalt ſuck the milk of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, and the breaſts of kings, yea, the breaſt of Chriſt, as I may ſo ſay, the King of kings, in whoſe breaſt lies a ſea of ſweetneſſe, where you may ſuck and ſmack, ſmack and ſuck, I, and ſo ye ſhall time out of minde, ſuck for thirſt, and thirſt by ſucking, becauſe of ſweetneſſe, divine time and age, outlaſting ſweetneſſe.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, it may be called new <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> in reſpect of her ſafety, thy ſafety, O <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> was but men and walles, and creatures ſtrength,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:171624:34"/>but thine, O new <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> is God in thee, and his ſalvation round about thee, is the ſafety of thee, <hi>Salvation will God appoint for walles and bulwarks.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of a city, <hi>ſure and ſtable, which cannot be ſhaken or moved:</hi> but for old <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> it was ſhaken, and ranſact too, and ſo ſhall all the cities in the world, firſt, or laſt, but thou, O new <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> city of ſafety, city of reſt, bleſſed city, everlaſting joy, and ſafety is in thee.</p>
               <p>Againe, in reſpect of her inhabitants in thee, O <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> was clean and unclean, circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and uncircumciſed, <hi>many were called Iewes which were not Iewes, but were the very Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue of Satan. Revel.</hi> 3.9.</p>
               <p>But for thee, O new <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> no unclean thing ſhall come into thee, God, and Chriſt will keep out of thee every uncircumciſed ſinner, I ſay, Chriſt will ſee, who comes into thee, O new <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Friend, where is thy wedding garment, bind him hand and foot, caſt him out, I will not have
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:171624:35"/>any unclean thing here, ſaith Chriſt, in any wiſe, <hi>Revel.</hi> 21.27. He is unclean, that was never waſhed in the fountaine of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> which ſtands open for ſinners, therefore ſaith <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> henceforth ſhall come no more into thee the uncircumciſed and unclean.</p>
               <p>Again, in reſpect of her temple in thee, O <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> was <hi>Solomons</hi> temple: but it was but a typicall temple; but in thee, O new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> is the true temple indeed. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.2. <hi>I ſaw no temple there,</hi> ſaith <hi>John, for the Lord God, and the Lambe was the temple of it.</hi> Ah! bleſſed temple, God and Chriſt, who would not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip here. <hi>One thing,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, have I deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the Lord, that I might dwell in his houſe all the dayes of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord.</hi> O <hi>David, here is thy wiſh, and more;</hi> for thou ſhalt not onely dwell in his houſe, but dwell in himſef: for God will now dwell with his <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and be her temple, O thou needeſt no other temple now to offer thy ſacrifices, for here ſhall all thy ſacrifices of thanksgiving be continually offered unto the Lord, and unto the Lambe: for he is thy temple now, where thou, and all thy fellow Saints muſt offer their ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and ſing their thankfulneſſe for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</p>
               <p>But I ſhall now hint at the laſt of theſe words, <hi>I ſaw her comming down from God out of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:171624:35"/>prepared as a Bride adorned for her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, I conceive, ſhe may be ſaid to come from God, as being borne of God; Chriſt ſpeaks of ſome in the firſt of <hi>Iohn,</hi> which were <hi>not borne of man, nor the will of man, but of God;</hi> a thing is ſaid, to be borne of that, of which it had its firſt being: O <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> in this ſence thou mayſt be ſaid truly, to be borne of God, and to come downe from God, for where hadſt thou thy firſt being? ſurely in God, yea, there thou hadſt a being long before all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; there waſt thou begotten indeed, begotten in his purpoſe, and in his love, yea, borne from everlaſting, and therefore art thou <hi>Melchiſedek</hi>-like, without Father, or Mother, and hadſt thy being only in the purpoſe of God.</p>
               <p>O how admirable it is, to thinke how long, as I may ſo ſay, God did travaile with his <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem;</hi> a woman travailing but a few months, is in paine and longs for deliverance: But O God, thou didſt with thy <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> not for a few months, or yeares, but a time longer, yea, farre more longer then a thouſand yeares, to a ſingle moment, from everlaſting was thy tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile.</p>
               <p>But, O God, was there not a longing in thee, or was it elſe a pleaſure to thee, it was both, it was both, O my deare <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:171624:36"/>
               <p> For firſt, It was a pleaſure to mee, in all the time I bare thee, my pleaſure was, I had thee, my pleaſure was, I bare thee; yea, a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying pleaſure, or if thou wilt delight, for <hi>I tooke ſolace in compaſſing the earth, and my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light was in the ſonnes of men;</hi> O God, ſeeing thou hadeſt many Angels, why couldſt thou not be ſatisfied? I wanted ſonnes and daughters that they might be my heires; we are now the ſons of God, and if ſons, then heires; yea, joynt heirs, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks.</p>
               <p>But, ah Lord, thou hadeſt a ſonne and heire before, but I had not ſonnes and daughters to make me a <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> where I might ſhew my glory. O Lord, hadſt thou not ten thouſand times ten thouſand Angels, Cherubims, and Seraphims? Yea, but all they were not halfe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for me, to ſhew my glory too, therefore I appointed as many more, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> the 1.14. That <hi>they ſhould be to the praiſe and glory of my grace;</hi> And ſo likewiſe in the 5. <hi>verſ. He hath predeſtinated us,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, through Ieſus Chriſt, according to the good pleaſure of his will, that we might be to the praiſe and glory of his grace, as well as Angels.</hi> But were not all man kinde appointed to ſet forth his glory? Yea, they were ſo; But ſhall they ſee his glory? No, no; But why not? Becauſe <hi>God will have mercy on whom he will, Rom.</hi> the 8. But doe
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:171624:36"/>not queſtion no further about this, but returne backe to the queſtion; which was, Whether there was not a longing in him, to ſee his ſonnes and daughters, with whom he travailed, though that too, were a pleaſure?</p>
               <p>Alas, he could not but long to ſee them, whom he had ſo long borne in his purpoſe; and nature it ſelfe will anſwer this; Doth not the Mother long to ſee the Childe ſhee bare? Surely yes, the Parent longs to ſee his Childe, ſo doth God his People too. Yea, how can he but long to ſee them, ſeeing they are his own from everlaſting, begotten in his purpoſe, and brought forth by his providence into this world, where he a while nurſeth them amongſt the vulgar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of this world, though they be Princes in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his eternall thoughts towards them? yet I ſay, they are nurſt as it were, and hardly kept for a few yeares til he ſend for them home, by death and angels, who indeed did alwayes tend thoſe Princes from the womb, for they have a charge with his ſonnes and daughters, to keep them in all their wayes whilſt they live, tend their ſoules whilſt they die; and ſurely no Ladies are readier to receive a Princeſſe into this world, to preſent it to the King its Father, then Angels are the ſoules of his Children when they dye; the Angels mind the very bodies of theſe Children turnd to duſt, and muſt give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:171624:37"/>of this duſt to Chriſt, for he ſhall one day ſend them to all the winds to pick it up, as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſpeaketh.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I <hi>Iohn, ſaw the holy City, new</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>deſcending down from God, prepared as a Bride;</hi> She deſcended, or came down from God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerv.</hi> Nothing comes up to God, but that deſcends from God; <hi>Fleſh and blood,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>cannot inherit the Kingdome of God;</hi> no, it is a corrupt thing, but <hi>corruption ſhall put on incorruption, and mortality put on immortality,</hi> but this <hi>incorruption</hi> and <hi>immortality</hi> too, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends from above, and therefore, <hi>I ſaw her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending down from God;</hi> the ſpirit and power of the mighty God, may be the thing for which the Evangeliſt ſaith, <hi>I ſaw new Ieruſalem com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming down from God, out of Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in the third place, <hi>I ſaw new Ieruſalem comming down, prepared, or trimmed like a Bride,</hi> a Bride is trimmed or adorned with new or beautifull garments, old ſpotred garments are ill beſeeming the Bride, and therefore ſhe never doth aray her ſelf, but in lovely ones. Well then, here is according to my light, the meaning of theſe words, and I think the very naturall ſence of the ſpirituall, as I may ſo ſay, or the ſpirituall meaning of the Spirit of God in theſe words. <hi>I John, ſaw the boly city, the new Iern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:171624:37"/>comming down, prepared as a Bride,</hi> the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt Ieſus, God, man, impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, reckoned and given to man by God, and put on by the mighty Spirit, is the newneſſe of it, and the adornment of her, and this righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of God. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>and the laſt.</hi> yea it is the righteouſneſſe of God, <hi>For he was made ſinne for us, who knew no ſinn, that we might be the righteouſneſſe of God in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well, by this mighty Spirit of God, is <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> arayed in this righteouſneſſe, wrought out by Chriſt for her, and ſo given by God for that ſame purpoſe, namely, <hi>Ieruſalems</hi> adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and now, he beholding her in this, he muſt needs ſay: <hi>I ſaw her deſcending down from God out of heaven trimmed as a Bride.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When ſhe is trimmed and arrayed by God, Chriſt, and the Spirit, yea, and ſhe muſt needs be now lovely and Bride-like beautifull; doth the ſpotted moon, and twinckling ſtars adorne the cloudy element, and make it ſo lovely, that a <hi>David</hi> cries out, <hi>O Lord how wonderfull are thy works. Pſalme.</hi> 8. <hi>v.</hi> 3. then muſt needs Chriſt the Sun of ſuns, and angels too, to make his <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> beautifull, when he ſhall cloath her with his own righteouſneſſe, as with a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, downe to the ground.</p>
               <p>Ofriends, this righteouſneſſe of Chriſt is the wedding garment of new <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and in this
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:171624:38"/>garment, ſaith <hi>Iohn, I ſaw her comming as a Bride trimmed for her husband.</hi> Chriſt the King of kings, Saints, and Angels, ſurely the kings daughter is all glorious without as well as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, for her cloathing is all embroidered gold, wrought out by Chriſt, and put on by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. O when the Saints ſhall wait on Chriſt up and down the heavens in this garment, or righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of his, how princelike will his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance bee, when ten thouſands of theſe ſhall ſtand before his throne, yea, ten thouſandmillions of theſe, with as many Angels to them, ſhall all as one joine to ſing his victories over ſin, death, hell, men, and devils, in this garment of love, and livery of his favour, what ſparkling beames will paſſe from one to the other, like ſuns refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting on each others glory, yet all from Chriſt, like Moon and ſtarres in their horizon.</p>
               <p>And now, O thou poor, and prodigall ſinner, what thinkeſt thou of that day, when it ſhall be ſaid, bring hither the beſt robe, and the gold ring, for this my once loſt, but now found ſon.</p>
               <p>O what a change will here be, when the rags in which thou tendedſt hogs ſhall be taken off, and thou cloathed with thy eldeſt brothers gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment brought thee, will not thy change be like <hi>Ioſhuahs,</hi> in putting off his filthy garment; yea, truely will it: if duſt were turned to gold, and common ſtones to jewels, nights to dayes, and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:171624:38"/>falling Commets to fixed ſtars, and then againe to beaming ſuns, yet all was nothing, I ſay, all theſe changes were nothing to that change that Chriſt maketh with ſinners, when hee takes off their ſins, rags and righteouſneſſe, and puts on his own righteouſneſſe on them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore well might <hi>John</hi> ſay, <hi>I ſaw her trimmed as a Bride,</hi> when he had trimmed her with his own righteouſnes; <hi>thou art comely,</hi> in my come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, ſaith Chriſt to the ſpouſe.</p>
               <p>Well reader, I hope in this interpretation, that thou and I am one, and doe agree, that this is the beauty of the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that the Spirit means by wedding garment, and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full adornment.</p>
               <p>And mark, becauſe it is this ſhe is trimmed with, therefore is ſhe ſaid to be ſeen <hi>comming down from heaven,</hi> as having none of this bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, but from God, Chriſt, and the Spirit.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>I ſaw new Jeruſalem comming down</hi> in an uniform manner, ſhee came not tumbling nor dropping, now and then a piece, as I may ſo ſay, nor in a ſcattering manner, but <hi>I ſaw new Ieruſalem,</hi> the whole Church, as one ſingle perſon comming down from God; the whole church is but one Bride, as I may ſo ſay, for Chriſt the Bridegroom, neither doth hee look on her any other wayes, nor ſhould wee: but we are like the ſilly country people, who
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:171624:39"/>ſometimes take the Courtier for the Prince, and the lachey ſervant for the maſter: ſo we many times, take the ſon for the Bridegroom, and the laſie profeſſor, who makes a fait ſhow, when as indeed, he is but a beggarly time ſerver, and hath no true grace nor vertue, for the noble and royall Chriſtian, though there be not ſuch an outward ſhow in reſpect of talk and perfection, which I ſpeak not againſt in a ſincere heart, but as I ſaid before, Chriſt counts his church but one, and ſo the Angel invites, ſaying, <hi>behold ye the Bride, the Lambs wife,</hi> and ſo ſaith himſelfe, <hi>my love, my dove,</hi> ſhe is but one, the onely one of her mother. And this may juſtly reprove ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in our dayes, who will diſtinguiſh the Church of Chriſt into as many parcels, as are formes, or judgements, and congregations, every one thinking themſelves to be the true Church, when as, at the beſt, they are but a piece of his <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as I apprehend, and that for theſe reaſons.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or the Church of God, though ſhe conſiſt of many Iewes and Gentiles, called and uncalled; yet in truth, ſhe is but one church or body, of which Chriſt is the head.</p>
               <p>Secondly, every particular perſon of the whole Church of Chriſt, being arayed and trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by God and Chriſt, may be called by the name of one ſingle perſon, and ſo counted the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:171624:39"/>Spouſe of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Againe, <hi>I ſaw new Jeruſalem comming down as a Bride,</hi> here he makes no diſtinction of bond or free, high or low, Independant, Anabaptiſt, Presbyterian, this, or that forme of fellowſhip: but he ſaw all theſe as in one <hi>comming down as a Bride,</hi> and now what ſhall I ſay of this <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> comming down in her bravery.</p>
               <p>Firſt, ſhe is richly cloathed, for it is in the righteouſneſſe of God, which is ſometimes cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a decking, or trimming, with ear-rings, or jewels; <hi>Iſaac</hi> trimmed <hi>Rebecka</hi> ſo, and how lovely was ſhe then in his eyes, ſurely very lovely.</p>
               <p>O when Chriſt ſhall look on his <hi>Rebecka,</hi> trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with his righteouſneſſe, as with ear-rings and jewels, how lovely will ſhe then be? will he not then ſay, <hi>Thou art all faire, my love, thou haſt raviſhed my heart with one of thine eyes,</hi> as <hi>Solomons ſongs.</hi> 4.9. Yea, ſhe will raviſh, as I may ſo ſay, the very heart of God to behold her in his Sons righteouſneſſe, or bravery, in the day of her eſpouſals to him, when ſhe is thus cloathed as a Bride for Chriſt the King of kings. O now who can behold any deformity in her, ſhe is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſibly, cloathed and covered with his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, from head to foot, as I may ſo ſay.</p>

                     </bibl> Behold, I ſtandat the doore and knocke, and if any man hear my voyce, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Shall very briefly hint at theſe words, without any preface at all; <hi>Behold,</hi> that is a word ſeriouſly to conſider. 2. The Perſon, <hi>I,</hi> what I is it? I the Lord of life, light and glory. 3. His Poſture, <hi>Behold I ſtand,</hi> I the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords; O high and low, great and humble Chriſt. 4. the Place, Where is that? At the doore, <hi>Behold I ſtand at the doore.</hi> 5. <hi>Behold I ſtand at the doore,</hi> not gazing up and down, but <hi>I ſtand knocking;</hi> for this end, to ſee if any man will heare and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, and then I will come in, and ſup with him, or refreſh him with my preſence.</p>
               <p>But firſt, <hi>Behold,</hi> this is a word never uſed in Scripture, but upon ſome very ſerious, great and weighty matter; this word, <hi>Behold,</hi> in Scripture, is like a fiery Beakon on a mighty Hill, which is to give warning to all Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants round about; or like the ſilver Trumpet in the Law, which was blowne to call the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God together, to the worſhip and ſervice of God; or like a Larum in the night to the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:171624:40"/>Souldier, which cries, arme, arme, arme all; or like an Enſigne, or Banner, which being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaid, gathers all to heare and ſee.</p>
               <p>For theſe reaſons the Spirit uſeth it in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; <hi>Bhold, a Virgin ſhall conceive and beare a Sonne, and his name ſhall be called Jeſus. Behold the Lambe of God, which taketh away the ſinnes of the world,</hi> John 1.29. <hi>Behold I come quickly,</hi> Revel. 3. And ſo in the laſt of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> to which the Spouſe ſaith, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, come Lord Jeſus, come quickly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Take notice of his patience, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I ſtand,</hi> I, the Lord of life and glory, I, the Saviour of the world, I, the Sonne of God, the Lambe of God, that was dead, but am alive, and live for evermore; I, that have this title on my thigh, the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, with the keyes of death, hell, in my hand, bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, looſing, and remitting whom I pleaſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, His Poſture, <hi>he ſtands,</hi> he ſits not, <hi>Behold I ſtand and knocke;</hi> What is that? wait for admittance, which doth denote his humility and patience; O humble Chriſt, Lord of life, light and glory, King of Nations, Saints and Angels, how doſt thou abaſe thy ſelfe to wait the ſinners leiſure? If a great man ſhould wait at a beggers doore, how would men won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der? Loe, Chriſt waits at thy doore, O begger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſinner, here is humility indeed, Chriſt the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:171624:41"/>King of Kings who hath ten thouſand times ten thouſand Angels at his heels, waits at thy doore, O gentle ſinner, did you ever ſee a Prince with his Nobles waiting at a beggers doore? no, I dare ſay, no; but heare is Chriſt the Prince of Princes, waiting at the ſinners doore, whilſt Angels and arch-Angels waits for a beck, with all readineſſe to doe his will; and this they count their heaven too: Princes uſes to ſend their pardons to malefactors, but Chriſt brings them, and waits the ſinners leiſure too.</p>
               <p>Chriſt, ſeeing thou haſt abaſed thy ſelfe, God ſhall highly exalt thee, above all the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Earth, and Angels too in Heaven; for to which of them hath he ſaid, <hi>Sit thee on my right hand, till I make thy enemies thy foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoole?</hi> O all muſt ſubmit to Chriſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is ſaid, <hi>At his name ſhall every kneee bow, both in heaven, earth, and under the earth,</hi> that is to ſay, Angels, men and Devils muſt ſubmit, or be diſpoſed by his appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to light, life and glory, or wrath, hell, or darkneſſe, even which he pleaſe: but it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes his patience too, as well as humility, if men be not ready to receive courteſie, we uſally withhold them: But Chriſt waits with patience the ſinners leiſure, who is ever buſie when Chriſt comes to him, in his houſe, or calling, the pleaſures, profits of the world, buying, ſelling,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:171624:41"/>eating, drinking, marrying, like the old world, who could not all heare <hi>Noahs</hi> preaching, no more then they at Chriſts knocks: O Chriſt, Why ſhouldeſt thou wait, ſeeing the ſinner is ſo careleſſe, to neglect his own welfare? Becauſe I am God, and not man, and my patience muſt be like my ſelfe, farre above yours, as the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens are above the earth, ſo is my patience a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all Men and Angels, and if it were not ſo, I ſhould have no admittance no where; for I come to no ſinners doore, but they make me ſtand and wait: ſometimes they doe not know me, and ſometimes they will not know me, and ſeldome it is too, they minde me, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it be in ſome great trouble, ſickneſſe, death, or danger, and then they cry, help, help, with their bitter teares; helpe, O Chriſt, helpe, which many times I doe; and after comes and ſees them, Doctor like, when they are well, and free; but then they think I am paid by their old prayers, and ſo will ſcarſe admit me, or deſire me to ſit down, my company now is bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenſome, though once they thought it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in their diſtreſſe and miſery. But O Chriſt, <hi>thou art the deſire of all Nations;</hi> who would not deſire and minde thee? for thou gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt Jewels, Crownes and Kingdomes, yea, Life, Light and Pardons, to all that do admit thee; but even the ſinner mindes not, nor
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:171624:42"/>knowes not thy gifts nor the richneſſe of it, or at leaſt way ſee no want of pardon, light, or knowledge; no, if he did, he would not ſtay ſo long waiting at his doore; how long O Chriſt? ten yeares at ſome, and twenty yeares at others, yea, forty yeares have I waited, <hi>till I was greived with them, and ſwore they ſhould never enter in unto my reſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well ſinner, happy is it, Chriſt hath ſo much patience to waight thy leaſure, do not abuſe this patience, leſt he leave thee, and forſake thee, and ſwear againſt thee by damning of thee, for neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting and abuſing his goodneſſe; many poor ſouls are in hell now for this very ſinne, negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting Chriſts patience, ſtanding at their hearts knocking for admittance, and yet, I dare ſay, there are ſome ſinners at whoſe doore Chriſt hath knocked twenty years by preachings, teachings, afflicting, and admoniſhing by his word, and his Spirit, and by example too.</p>
               <p>But what doe I ſpeake of twenty yeares, are there not ſome gray-headed ſinners, at whoſe doore Chriſt hath often knockt heretofore, but now they are deaf, and cannot heare, and the things belonging to their peace are hid from their eyes, as once from <hi>Ieruſalems,</hi> for whoſe miſery Chriſt wept, and ſo will ye over your own ſouls one day in flames of hell.</p>
               <p>O me thinks, I ſee poor ſouls ſit looking on
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:171624:42"/>one another; weeping bitterly for their folly, in not minding Chriſts knocks when time was.</p>
               <p>O ſaith the aprentiſe wringing of his hands, with heart breaking ſighs, I was ſeven yeares in a godly family, where my maſter prayed, read, and expounded every day: by which Chriſt oft knockt at my heart, and made me to reſolve for to let him in; but I was yong, and thought it was too ſoon to hear him yet, but I made account to do it, when my time was out, but Chriſt then did not knock, or at leaſt, I minded him not: for the world, wife, and children came upon mee, that I did not once minde him.</p>
               <p>And ſo another Bible-carrier doth much the like. O ſaith he, in theſe flames weeping, I went twiſe every Sunday in the yeare to the Church with my wife and family, heard-prayers, took my booke, turnd to text and proofes, and had Chriſt knocking at my heart too, but I know not how, ſtill I forgot all, and Chriſt knocks too, who at laſt left to knock at all; but I went ſtill to Church with my neighbours ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the cuſtome, with old father world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, who would alwayes talk of buſineſſe, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing home and comming, putting all good things quite out of my minde, for which, curſed be the time that ever I did ſee him; for it may beels, I might have minded ſomething, what I heard of there, as well as many others, whom
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:171624:43"/>wee counted puritanes, becauſe they would ſtill be talking what good matter they had heard, and how ſweet it was, talking of the uſes: but as we followed after, wee laughing for to hear them goe conning over the ſermon, one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all the way home, not at all minding what he ſaid to us, but how he met with ſuch a one, and ſuch a one, and never minded once at all our ſelves, like unhappy ſoules, for which we muſt lie in the flames for ever, to repent our folly, and houle for our miſery, in not harkening unto Chriſt, when the time was, which never ſhall be more.</p>
               <p>O ſaith, wrinkled faced hypocrite in the flames at the bottome, I deceived my ſelf, &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny an honeſt Chriſtian too, like a curſed wretch, for I was a great profeſſor ſeven years together, in which time, Chriſt gave me many a hard rap at the door of conſcience, for my hollow-heart, ſometimes telling me, I was a masked ſinner, and had a rotten heart, ayming at the world, name, fame, credit, all the while profeſſion was in requeſt, going up and down with many ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Chriſtians, and would be talking with them in matters of religion for many by ends, little minding Chriſts thundring knocks againſt ſuch as I: crying, woe, woe, woe to the hypocrites, Scribes, and the Phariſees, one that did love much to have preheminency, though a great profeſſor,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:171624:43"/>bearing ſway, and rule, juſt like a Biſhop over the Church of Chriſt, lord and maſter-like, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he was chief, and muſt be beleeved, and obeyed in his forme, minding this, his owne ſelfe and intereſt, more then the honour of his maſter, or the good of poore Chriſtians, whom hee ſeldome went to viſit without his doctors fee, or the hope of a ſermon, if in caſe he died, worth him five pound; Woe, woe to thoſe that ſo neglect the Church of Chriſt, and the poore Saints, who ſometimes lies in cottages, and ſellers, where their worſhips will not come, it is to mean a thing, becauſe they are maſters, and called, <hi>Rabbi, Rabbi,</hi> which, the true Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciple never aymed at.</p>
               <p>But ſtay, I had like to forget one ſinner more, where Chriſt hath long ſtood, and uſually doth, yea, longer then at any doore beſides, I mean the ſimple Chriſtian, or the ignorant Chriſtian, who knowes not right or left hand in religion, more then his grandmother taught him bringing of him up, according to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome which their parents left them, building their religion on the old race, yet muſt ſtill be called Chriſtian, for his baptiſme ſake: which I ſpeak not againſt, but the mans ignorance, which the Lord knowes, I pitty; for truely at theſe poore ſoules doore, doth Chriſt knock many times: but the ſoule is ſo ſimple, it doth not
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:171624:44"/>know Chriſt when he knocks, but gapes, and ſtares on the Parſon in the pulpit, when it is Chriſt that knocks at the heart, with life, light, and knowledge, which is more worth then jewels, crownes, and kingdomes; yea, the gold of <hi>Ophir,</hi> and the rich ſhips of <hi>Tharſhiſh:</hi> but poore ſimple, ſotted, and deluded ſoule, thou knoweſt not the want of this knowledge, Chriſt, and thy ſouls miſery for want of knowledge.</p>
               <p>And here, miſtake me not, for I doe not mean unlearned men, more then learned men; for truely, many of them, which are great Grecians know not the A.B.C. in the new creature, but by heare ſay poore ſimple ſouls, how many ſuch be there in the world, doe you not know thouſands, that are cryed up for wiſe, able men, though not ſuch great Schollers, yet cried up for able men, fit for Jewry, Judge, or Juſtice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which I doe not ſpeak againſt, but honour; yet I ſay, I will take a young ſtripling in the ſchool of Chriſt, without an haire on his face, ſhall winde him like a childe in the worke of conviction for ſin, Chriſt knocking at thy heart, and the Spirits working in the new man; and old, and ſound experienced things.</p>
               <p>I ſay, in theſe things, he will wind your old ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid blades &amp; many Churchwardens, who ſhould be knowing men, as well as Furre-gowned, where Chriſt hath often knockt, before ever
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:171624:44"/>that came on him, but now he thinks it is enough to ſit by his white rod in a majeſtick way, with a black ſoule, by cheating of the poor, to feaſt his own ungodly gut, with capon, ſack, and claret, till his belly be ſo ſwelld, that Chriſt cannot come at his heart, or ſeldom doth hereafter; for, for the moſt, they turne drunkards, not that <hi>I</hi> mean right blading, curſed, or down right drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards: but I mean, in a dry way without any roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, by clubbing pot after pot, and then an half pint, and another to that, with a point at the laſt to ſet the reckoning right, and a gell of ſtrong water to cloſe up their ſtomake, I am ſure I know ſome, that will ſit with a coughing, and ſpauling diſcourſe, from four to ſix, from ſix to eleven, with aſerious diſcourſe in a cavilere way, of a turn that ſhall be, but I do not know when: and ſo they drink healths, ſaying, you know who I mean, in a myſticall way, from one to another, till all be halfe drunk, and then they depart with an equall proportion toward the ſhot; but I will bid theſe good night, and come cloſſe to the matter in a ſpirituall way, for I think it as vain to ſpeak to them now, as it is to expect a ſwallow in winter.</p>
               <p>Well, the next thing is, the place where Chriſt knocks, which is the door, O that is without you know, who is without, why, who is within, that the King of glory is without, why, who is within,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:171624:45"/>that Chriſt ſtands without? ſinne, Satan, the world pleaſure, profits, and they alwayes keep Chriſt without, till he breakes in, and whips theſe buyers and ſellers out of his Temple, which Chriſt ſometimes doth, as well as once thoſe out of <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple; but for preſent, Chriſt is without, Chriſt the Lord of life and glory, who ſtands with pardons, peace and mercy for their ſoules, if he might once be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; but what if he be not? then they are undone, for they muſt die without them, and be damned too, for the abuſe of his patience; therefore minde it careleſſe ſinner, before Chriſt goes and takes his leave for knocking any more, which Chriſt will one day doe, when he cannot have admittance for the worlds plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, profits.</p>
               <p>But ſure it is impoſſible Chriſt ſhould be without, whilſt they are within; nay, it is true enough, doe you not heare him knock? I heare ſome body, but I doe not think it is Chriſt, you doe not thinke it is Chriſt; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times you doe not heare at all for buſineſſe; and ſometimes you doe not heare for careleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; when ſhall Chriſt have admittance? (when) when I am for my ſelfe, ſaith the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and can tend to open; and when I have this, or that eſtate, ſaith the worldling, and for every childe a portion; ſo ſaith the vaine chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:171624:45"/>or much to this purpoſe, when I have my ſwing of pleaſure, I will tend Chriſt, and till then he muſt wait; and thus the ſervant puts off Chriſt, for freedome, and the worldling, for eſtate, and the luxurious, for his pleaſure, all abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Chriſt, and his patience too.</p>
               <p>But if theſe delayes Chriſt ſhould take, for full and flat denyals, what will then become of their immortall ſoules, worth more then crowns and kingdomes, or ten thouſand worlds, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are immortall and breathed once from God? But now muſt die in their ſinnes, as Chriſt told the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and periſh too for him; and now they had been happy, if they had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard of him, nor his knocks neither; which ſeeing they have ſlighted, ſhall damne them with a vengeance. (But how doe you know it is Chriſt that knocks?) Poore ſimple ſoule, doe you not know it, that ſeemes thou art not much acquainted with Chriſt, nor his knocks, when thou doſt not know that; when the Servant knowes his Maſter, and the Childe his Parent, every thing knowes more then thee, the Sheep the Shepherds whiſtle, the Bee his own Hive, and the Aſſe his Maſters Crib, <hi>but my People knowes not me,</hi> ſaith the Lord, by his Prophet <hi>Iſaiah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I will helpe thee, what I can to learne Chriſts knocks, expecting thou wilt open,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:171624:46"/>when he comes againe? 'tis Chriſt knocks (mark me.)</p>
               <p>Firſt, I know it is Chriſt that knocks, he knocks thunderingly, or loudly. 2. I know it is Chriſt that knocks, by his ſtill and ſoft knocks. 3. I know it is Chriſt, by his ſlow and leiſurely knocks. 4. I know it is Chriſt, by his ſweet and pleaſant knocks. 5. I know it is Chriſt, by the place, he knocks at the doore, where he uſally comes in, and not at a window, or a by way.</p>
               <p>But why doth Chriſt knock ſo loud and thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deringly? He thinkes you are aſleepe, or dead ſure, as every man and woman too, is by nature; and therefore ſaith Chriſt, <hi>The dead ſhall he are my voyce and live,</hi> as in <hi>John</hi> 5.25.</p>
               <p>This Chriſt doth not meane of the day of Judgement, though that be true, that by Chriſts voyce and power, the dead ſhall one day heare, and every man be ſtarted from his grave; ſome for glory, moſt for wrath and vengeance, or execution; like malefactors, with chaines of guilt about their necks and conſciences, bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up their feares about them, which heavier laies then milſtones.</p>
               <p>O how dreadfull will this reſurrection be, when millions of ungodly ſoules ſhall come to joyne with curſed bodies. It is ſaid, <hi>Iephthah</hi> wept and tore his haire, when he ſaw his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:171624:46"/>and the Virgins of <hi>Iſrael</hi> come to meet him; but ſurely this meeting of damned ſoules and curſed bodies, will bee much more bitter to thy body, who laid in duſt ſilent, free from paine; happy were it for thy body, if it might ſtill live with wormes, and mouldring rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſilent darkneſſe; but it cannot be, Chriſt muſt have thee out, and judge thee too, for thy ungodly deeds and acts, as well as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward his Saints for all their works wrought by his Spirit in their ſoules.</p>
               <p>But I ſhall forget my ſelfe. The thing was, that I was ſpeaking too, Sure Chriſt knew the ſinner was aſleep, or dead, that he did not open; and truly a ſinner may be well ſaid to be dead, till Chriſt comes to live in him, becauſe Chriſt is the Fountaine of life; and therefore if Chriſt be not in the ſoule, it muſt needs then be dead, at leaſt in a ſpirituall ſence, for want of Chriſt; for as the ſoule is the life of the body, ſo Chriſt is the life of the ſoule, and therefore when thou keepſt Chriſt out, thou keepſt thy ſoule from thy ſoule; O death and ſleepy ſinner.</p>
               <p>But why doth he knock ſo ſoftly? becauſe he would not fright you, Chriſt would come in a milde and gentle way, and not in a furions way, which he often doth to many ſoules, who hath long kept him out by delayes and ſinnes,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:171624:47"/>but Chriſſt doth not alwayes doe ſo.</p>
               <p>You know he diſcourſed and reaſoned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe at the Well of <hi>Iacob</hi> unto the Woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> and invited himſelfe to <hi>Zacheus</hi> houſe, bringing ſalvation with him, and ſo did not at all fright the little man, though a great ſinner; the <hi>Ethiopian</hi> found Chriſt in his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot, by reading of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and many a ſoule doth the like by a good booke, reading in a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate way, where Chriſt comes, breathing life and peace to their ſoules, as once to the Diſciples when the doores was all ſhut, and they met in a roome, where Chriſt comes, and breathes the holy Ghoſt on them.</p>
               <p>But Thirdly, Why doth Chriſt knock ſo ſlowly? that you might conſider, who it is that knocks, and opens to him; the Turtle hath a ſweet and penetrating voyce, but the moſt ſlow of any creature; you ſeldome heare her often at one time, but ſhe cals her mate once, and then is ſilent for a while, and then ſhe ſweetly cals againe, in a mournfull way, even to the peircing of a mans heart, as it were, with her ſweet and ſerious, yet dolourous call, but with a pretty diſtance of time, between every call.</p>
               <p>Well, ſo doth Chriſt by the ſoule, Chriſt comes by a Sermon, jogs and cals ſweetly to thy heart; ſometimes by death in a dolourous
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:171624:47"/>way, percing thy heart, for a wife, a child, a hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; ſometimes at night, in a ſilent way by thy bed ſide, ſaying, ſinner, ſinner, art thou a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waked? it is time to riſe, what doſt thou mean? ariſe, ariſe, looke about thee, get thy cloaths, prepare for death, by minding it, heaven, hell, and eternity, and thy ſoules condition, and its eternity, which if it ſhould miſcarry thou art undone; it is time, high time, and yet not to late, if thou wilt reſolve thy ſelfe in earneſt, to minde me, and thy ſoules welfare, which is the only thing neceſſary; and therefore know, thy ſoules life and pardon is the maine thing, when will that be minded? if thou ſhouldſt delay this time, now away, time may be no more, no more for ever; and then thou wilt weep like <hi>Eſau,</hi> yea, bitterly weep, crying, <hi>haſt thou not one bleſſing more,</hi> when <hi>Iacob</hi> hath the maine, and thou canſt not have it, for he hath gotten it already. Chriſt tels the <hi>Iewes, Many ſhall come from the Eaſt and from the Weſt, and ſhall ſit down with Abraham, Iſaack, and Iacob; but they ſhall be caſt into utter darkneſſe, where ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth.</hi> And ſo ſaith Chriſt ſoftly to thy ſoul, this, or that ſinner may be ſaved, and thou dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and how wilt thou weep, when thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours childe, wife, parent, be received, and thou caſt off, yea, into hell, for neglecting,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:171624:48"/>ſlighting me, my ſlow, and mournfull knocks, minding thee of the grave, death, and eternity, which will ſtraight be here, what doſt thou mean to build caſtles in the aire, doeſt thou know how long thou ſhalt live.</p>
               <p>Death hath been at thy neighbouts, and fetcht away his children, yea, in thine own houſe, for a friend, a wife, a child, a ſervant, and he will come again to morrow, or ere it be long, didſt thou not meet with a coffin, nor hear a paſſing bell: hark, it is going now, whilſt the death watch clickers, ſet thy houſe in order, quickly, quickly, it is very dangerous, all delayes breed danger; but this, O ſinner, ſimple ſinner, more then any, yea, any in the world; thou talkeſt of wife and children, and providing for them, I pray thee, ſinner, minde thy ſoule, let that be ſerved firſt, it is time enough for them, what is wife and children to thy ſoule, thy deare and precious, everliving ſoule, if that be loſt, all is loſt for ever, then what good will their wellfare doe thee, O ſinner, this will no more advantage thee, then a little thetch when the houſe and ſubſtance is all burnd. Oſinner, it is thy ſoul that is the ſubſtance, and the treaſure too: for thy ſouls ſake, have a care, it is immortall, everliving, and ſhall never die, why ſhouldſt thou be cruell to thine own ſoul, or unkind, and careleſſe of its welfare, haſt thou any more ſoules? if thou loſe one ſoule, doeſt
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:171624:48"/>thou not loſe all, all thou haſt, and all thou canſt? other loſſes may be gaind; name may be gaind, and friends may be gaind, and eſtate too, before that thou dieſt: but if it be not, thou mayſt be happy; yea, as an Angel of God.</p>
               <p>But can thy ſoul be gained, being once loſt, No, no, it cannot be once loſt, and loſt for ever; yea, unrecoverable, O when men loſe their friends, wife, children, husbands, lands, living, it cuts deep: O but this ſoule of thine will cut ten thouſand times deeper, that is very neere, but this ten thouſand times neerer; one creature may make up another in reſpect of loſſe, but who can make up thy ſoul, if it be once loſt; ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row cannot do it, ſighs cannot do it, teares can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not doe it, though they like brine, be ſteeped with ſence of miſery. O ſinner thy loſſe is irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable, men cannot help thee, Angels cannot help thee, God cannot help thee; nay, Chriſt himſelfe cannot doe thee any good: what wilt thou now doe? weep thou mayeſt in vaine, cry thou mayeſt in vaine, howle thou mayeſt in vain, none now will pitty thee, though thou weep ſeas, and ſeas again to Chriſt; it will be all in vaine: for bowels are all ſhut up, all that are in men, all that are in Angels, all that are in God, all that are in Chriſt, men would once pitty thee, for a wife, a childe, a friend; Angels would once ſhelter thee from dangers, and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:171624:49"/>Chriſt would once weepe for thee, O <hi>Ieruſalem, Ieruſalem,</hi> Chriſt would once faſt for thee, Chriſt would once bleed for thee, Chriſt would once live for thee, Chriſt would once die for thee, and goe into the grave, that thou mighteſt goe to heaven: but all bowels now are quite ſhut up, all in God, all in Chriſt, all in Angels, all in men, all in friends, for they are buying, ſelling, and never minde thy howling; nay, thy wife, and children doe not think upon thee, though thou didſt them once, more then thy ſoule, labouring ſtill for riches for to leave behind thee, and never thought on Chriſt to take along with thee, in thy long journey, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the mighty ſeas of time and eternity, which is the dying minute, where devils lyes like robbers, catching every poor ſoule that hath not Chriſt to guide them, and ſo will he do thine; the firſt ſtep thou ſettſt in it, hurling thee a long in a furious way of darkneſſe, fear, and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, trembling like the partridge in the Falkons talent, and Satan ſwiftlier carrying thy ſoule a long to hell, then lightning flies in ayre, or thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der bolts falles downward, where <hi>Dives</hi> minds his brethren, but ſeldome they do him, thou mayeſt doe the like by thy wife and children, but they will not think on thee; for thou art quite forgotten, <hi>for no remembrance is in grave,</hi> or at leaſt of thy ſoule, and its ſad condition,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:171624:49"/>men will laugh and talke, whilſt thou weepſt, and howlſt, friends will doe the like while thou ſhreekſt and cryſt, Saints are ſinging, <hi>holy, holy,</hi> whilſt thou art wailing, weeping, and wringing of thy hands, with bitter teares, and ſoul-full ſighs: while Angels ſing with light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome hearts, like to the Saints, thou lyeſt a cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, juſt like the devils, ſometime God that made thee, and ſometimes ſhee that bare thee, as well as thy father; ſometimes the dayes, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the nights, in which thou riotedſt hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſometimes thy ſelf, thy ſoule, thy body, ſometimes thy friends, and old companions of thy ſinnes, whom once thou lovedſt, and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redſt more then many good Chriſtian, who then told thee of this day, which thou then alwayes thoughteſt was but untrue, or elſe a great way off, but now thou art a curſing every one that cometh within thy heavy, ſad and dolefull thoughts; ſometimes thy nurſe, ſometimes thy midwife, becauſe ſhe did not ſtrangle thee, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the miniſter for no oftener feeding thee, when thou waſt ſquay &amp; ſquemiſh, and wouldſt not diſgeſt any thing from him, ſomething was too hard, and ſomething was too plaine, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was too high, and ſomething was too low, ſomething was too ſoon, and ſomething never ſhould be, though hee preached it never ſo oft, and preſt it on thee too, with arguments from
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:171624:50"/>heaven, and arguments from hell, with all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe under the ſun: which thou refuſedſt and mindedſt it not, but frownd, and quarreld, and raild, and jeard, with wicked men, and ſaidſt, thou wouldſt never heare him more; but ſuch a one ſhould be thy Paſtor, he ſmoothd thee up, and pleaſed thee well, but now thou ſeeſt what is come on it.</p>
               <p>But I feare, I ſhall offend in running wide from the words, though it be in a way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, and therefore come to another queſtion.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, why doth Chriſt knock ſo ſweetly, to tempt and allure you, to open to him for his many ſweet knocks; and many a ſoule Chriſt winnes by this kind of knocking, which opens, as it were, all the vaines and powers in the ſoule wide unto Chriſt, and as freely entertaine him, as ever did <hi>Zacheus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, why doth Chriſt knock at the doore, becauſe he will come in there, or no where, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers climbs the walles, but Chriſt will at the doore, or no where, if he comes, he can come in if he pleaſe any where, at the window, or top of the houſe: but you know Chriſt loves to come in at the doore of conſent, which is the common way of Chriſts comming to every ſoul.</p>
               <p>But the doore, what is that, the heart, the heart of man, what would it bee, but why doe
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:171624:50"/>ye call that a door: firſt, becauſe it is the inlet to the houſe. Secondly, it is the outlet to the houſe, ſo is the heart to the ſoule: as Chriſt comes in at the heart, ſo the world, ſin, and Satan goes out at the heart, <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>my ſon give me thy heart,</hi> well knowing, if he hath this doore, he may lay what he will with in.</p>
               <p>But you ſaid, I may know it was Chriſt by his thundring knocks, but what do you call Chriſts thundring knocks, I mean his thundring judgements to the world, the nations, and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of the world round about, in all which Chriſt is now a thundring, rouzing them from their dens of pomp, glory, and greatneſſe, to exalt himſelf, and Saints, in the roome of ſinners, which muſt be done in every kingdome, before that all be huſht, and <hi>Chriſt all in all,</hi> and the kingdomes his according to Gods promiſe, <hi>I will give thee the uttermoſt part of the earth for thy poſſeſſion,</hi> ſaith God by his prophet <hi>David. Turke, Pope,</hi> and <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> Princes, have kept the nations of the world, and made poore Saints ſquelke, and hide themſelves in new plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, to keep their conſciences free from their idolatrous worſhip.</p>
               <p>But Chriſt is now a meaſuring out lands and livings for them, yea, cities, towns, and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, by his proſpering armies, which mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, by cutting every one ſome: which makes
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:171624:51"/>the mighty grumble, as if they were loſing all, and ſo they are in danger too: if Chriſt be juſtled by them in his way of providence by his thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring knocks.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I meane by Chriſts thundring knocks, thoſe righteous judgements, which thou ſeeſt befall private wicked men, Chriſt braines on by his thunder bolts, that twenty more might feare, ſometimes ſtrikes the drunkard with a deadly ſurfet, and ſometimes the worldling with a deadly heat and cold, and here and there a ſinner, that thouſands more might be warned.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I meane by Chriſts thundring knocks, when Chriſt knocks like a Bell-man, at midnight, in thy dead ſleep, crying, fire, fire, fire, and is not this a thundring knock: I truely, it would make a man ſtart out of his bed naked, to ſave his houſe, to ſave his goods, truely, thus Chriſt knocks at a ſinners heart, or door.</p>
               <p>Firſt, by judgements to the world, as I ſaid before.</p>
               <p>Secondly, by judgements on ungodly men, whom, firſt or laſt, Chriſt will meet withall, when they have fild their meaſure, which thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands doe apace, ſome by ungodly deeds, ſome by ungodly ſpeeches, which Chriſt will reckon with them for, as it is ſaid in <hi>Jude.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, by Chriſt crying out at mid-night,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:171624:51"/>fire, fire, which frights a poore man, that his ſin, ſin, death, hell, hell, and how doth this, like a fire at midnight, fright a man out of his ſleep. And truely, many ſinners doth Chriſt awake at mid-night, that is an unexpected time.</p>
               <p>Secondly, at midnight, in his deep ſleep of drunkenneſſe, uncleanneſſe, or ſuch like ſinnes: ſo you ſee what I meane by Chriſts thundring knocks. I ſaith one, I have experience of this, he awaked mee from my <hi>Dalilah,</hi> the ſinne wherein I lay: I too, ſaith another, that wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in his ſinnes for twenty yeares together: Chriſt falls upon a ſinner by this kind of knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, like three or foure enraged enemies upon a man, crying, downe with him, downe with him, and ſo beats him down, leaving him even dead, and ſo goes away: but the Spirit comes, and viſites him, and raiſes him up againe, by telling him, his ſinnes are not paſt, the cure of faith and repentance, which Chriſt both gives to the man whom he wounds thus, with the ſence of his ſinnes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, what doe you meane by Chriſts ſoft knocks, by Chriſts ſoft knocks, I mean his mild, and gentle way of comming to a ſinner, craving of his due from him, and not like that cruell ſervant, <hi>who finding out his debter, caught him by the throat preſently, ſaying, pay me ſtraight,</hi> and would have no compaſſion on him.</p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:171624:52"/>
               <p> But Chriſt, by his ſoft knocks, comes to a poor indebted ſinner, &amp; ſayes unto him, Friend, friend, doeſt thou remember what thou oweſt mee? yes, yes, ſaith the ſinner, little minding how much it is, and ſo is ſtraight a going: nay, but ſtay, ſtay friend, ſaith Chriſt, let mee reckon with thee before thou goeſt: which the ſinner leſſe loves, then the broken Bankerout to look into, or caſt up his books, and therefore prayes Chriſt to come to morrow, <hi>he is now buſie, buying of a Farm,</hi> or ſetting up his ſhop. O but Chriſt tels him, he will neither ſtay, nor come againe; but arreſt him ſtraight by death, which ſtartles ſo the ſinner, that hee now ſaith, I will ſtay, and heare all I owe thee, and then Chriſt tels him.</p>
               <p>Sinner, firſt, thou oweſt mee thy ſoule, I bought it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, thy body, I redeemed it by my blood.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, thy eſtate and gifts, I gave it thee.</p>
               <p>O Chriſt, thou demands all: why, do not I deſerve all? and thou owe me all? yea, O Chriſt, but I would fain keep my eſtate to ſerve my wife and children, and my gifts and parts; becauſe they are of great eſteem with men now a dayes: Friend, do not talk of wife &amp; children, I muſt have thy eſtate, thy gifts, and parts too, let men eſteeme them how they will, I muſt have them all.</p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:171624:52"/>
               <p> O Chriſt, this is hard pay, but I will pay thee ſome and ſome, as I am able: do not tell me of that, I muſt have them all now, and it is not ſo hard as due, or as thou thinkſt for, either: for I learn this leſſon to all my poor indebted ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, yea, every one, and I tell thee man for thy comfort, when I have learnd them this leſſon, I do give them back their eſtates again, with intereſt twenty in the hundred, and ſo I do their parts with the ſame advantage: but, O Chriſt, wilt thou do ſo by mee? if I give thee my whole e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, gifts, and parts.</p>
               <p>Friend, I alwayes do ſo, truſt me, try mee, prove mee. O Chriſt, I will, I will: well friend, let me tell thee, as I am Chriſt, thou ſhalt never loſe by it: but ſhalt have the light of life, and glory to the bargain.</p>
               <p>O, but what doe ye meane by Chriſts ſlow knocks: I mean, all the good purpoſes he puts in your ſoules: as to read a chapter, go to prayers in the ſence of his goodneſſe, to hear a ſermon, to lead a new life, to ſerve God better; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore friends, as you vallue Chriſts company, or your own ſouls, looke to theſe knocks of good purpoſes, by Chriſts knocking in your hearts.</p>
               <p>Many ſoules are damnd in the yeare for neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting theſe purpoſes, O ſaith one, I was going for to open, but I think, I was bewitched by my old companions, and I too, ſaith another, but
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:171624:53"/>there came ſome to buy commodities, and kept mee in my ſhop; and I too ſaith another: but my friends began to jear, and ſaid, I would not now turn fool, would <hi>I,</hi> to open unto Chriſt, all the world would but laugh at me, to minde him ſo ſoon before the worlds profits, pleaſures, which every one almoſt feekes firſt of all: and then Chriſt, when they die; which was one M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Carefulls</hi> ſpeech to his ſon <hi>Worldling</hi> many yeare agoe: which <hi>I</hi> thinke all his ſons did very much mind, and ever ſince have practiſed: but <hi>Zacheus</hi> a convert by Chriſts knocking at his heart, and inviting of himſelf to dinner.</p>
               <p>But thirdly, what do you mean by Chriſts ſlow knocks, evening meditations telling thee of death, and eternity, the vanity of the world, the empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the creature, the neceſſity of himſelf.</p>
               <p>O ſaith Chriſt, the world is vain by knocking at the ſoule, <hi>Solomon</hi> hath found it ſo, and all the ſons of wiſedome too. One ſaid it would not ſatisfie the ſoule of any man, no more then mitigate the paines of the body: another ſaid, it was changeable like the Moon, and weather: ſometimes in Eclins, ſometimes clear again, not a moneth conſtant all the yeare about: but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering mens conditions, who live below the Sun: ſometimes into ſear, ſometimes into care, ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome out of trouble all the yeare about, which are ſo ſtrong in many, that they can ſcarcely
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:171624:53"/>ſleep either day or night, and ſtill after the world, which changes like the Moone,</p>
               <p>O happy were it for theſe ſoules, if Chriſt would knock, or tell them, they are dead and buried in cares of the world, and ſo raiſe them up to live in himſelf, and minde the other death and eternity beyond.</p>
               <p>O death and eternity, who mindes yee, and yet thou kilſt and hourds up all yea all, high, low, rich, poore, young, and old, in thy two gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of hell and heaven, but the Saints onely there, which Chriſt fetcheth in by his ſerious knocks.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, I mean by Chriſts ſlow knocks his night knocks of affliction, ſuch as ſtraits, wants, ſickneſſe, reproach, and diſgrace; O friends, Chriſt knocks at the door of your hearts by all theſe; bleſſed, and for ever bleſſed is ſuch a ſoule, that heares Chriſt by theſe kinde of knocks.</p>
               <p>But what doe you meane by Chriſts ſweet knocks? I meane by Chriſts ſweet knocks, his telling thee of thy Fathers love, the ſtrength and length of this love, with thy intereſt in it; O ſaith Chriſt, my Father ſo loves thee, that he thinks nothing too dear for thee; <hi>God ſo loved the world, that he gave his onely begotten Son;</hi> yea, and more he could not give, for in him he gives himſelf, and all we have, and all we need;
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:171624:54"/>and therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Seeing he hath given us his Sonne, how ſhall be not with him give us all things, life, pardon, heaven, happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſalvation;</hi> and therefore Chriſt is called, <hi>The Guift of God, John</hi> 7. <hi>Hadſt thou known the Guift of God,</hi> ſaith Chriſt to the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Samaria;</hi> and indeed to this Guift all is nothing; If a Prince ſhould give his favour, what was that to Chriſt? If he ſhould give thee houſes, mannours, lordſhips, what was that to Chriſt? If he ſhould give thee crownes and kingdomes, what was that to Chriſt? honours, mannours, lordſhips, crownes, and kingdomes, are but nothing unto Chriſt, the Gift of God to a poore ſinner: well might <hi>Paul</hi> ſay, <hi>O the height, depth, and breadth of this love,</hi> which he acquaints the ſoule with, by his ſweet knocks, and of his intereſt in it too.</p>
               <p>O ſaith Chriſt to the ſinner, <hi>It is firmely ſet upon thee, and cannot be removed, mountaines may be moved, but my Fathers love cannot; though the mountaines ſhould be removed, yet my loving kindneſſe will I not remove.</hi> Men cannot, Devils cannot move it, ſinne cannot move it; <hi>If my Children forſake my Law, yet my loving kindneſſe will I not take away,</hi> ſaith God by <hi>David,</hi> Mark, <hi>my loving kindneſſe will I not take away;</hi> I will onely viſit them with a rod: O ſaith Chriſt, <hi>once beloved and
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:171624:54"/>ever;</hi> men may love and hate, but God cannot, he is unchangeable, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. and ſo is his love too; his love is grounded in his Son, and ſpread in all relations to ſhew the greatneſſe of it; the Friend loves as a freind, the Bridegroome as the Husband, the Father as the Parent, but Gods love is all at once; yea all, and more then all, ten thouſand times over, and over againe to that. And therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Behold what manner of love is this,</hi> how great? how ſweet? how deare? how neare is this Father, Friend, and Husbands love? <hi>As a Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom rejoyces over his Bride, ſo will I rejoyce over my People to doe them good,</hi> ſaith the Lord, by his Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well Friend, Chriſt acquaints the ſoul of this love by his ſweet knocks, which even melts it, like the Suggar in the Wine.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, I meane by Chriſts ſweet knocks, his acquainting thee of the Fathers glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, thy intereſt in this glory; Gods glory make the heavens heaven, and fils the heavens too, and makes them heavens indeed to Saints and Angels, and all that doe dwell there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> had once a glimps of this glory, and it was unutterable; <hi>Moſes</hi> with the very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of it, forſook <hi>Pharohs</hi> court, and choſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be afflicted with the People of God, then to live in his court, and glory, and be the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:171624:55"/>Sonne in law to that great King of <hi>Egypt. Paul</hi> having once a glimple of it, deſires <hi>to dye, and be diſſolved,</hi> that he might enjoy it: <hi>David</hi> cries out, ſaying, <hi>It is wonderfull, yea, it fils Heaven and Earth,</hi> ſaith he, in his <hi>Pſalms.</hi> And ſo it ſhall thy ſoul too, ſaith Chriſt, by his ſweet knocks at the heart; O ſaith Chriſt, <hi>I will fill thee with this glory, and wrap thee in this glory, and cloth thee head and foot, and thou ſhalt be like</hi> Solomon, <hi>yea, like Angels, clothed with ſplendor from the God of glory.</hi> And now, what thinkſt thou of it ſinner, if thou ſhouldſt ſee a lovely Princes arayed and clothed in gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Tiſſue, lac'd and trimm'd with Jewels, it were a gallant ſight; but O alaſſe, ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of theſe were all but nothing to ſet off thy glory, O arayed Saint, by God and Chriſt in righteouſneſſe. But when ſhall I have this glory? ſaith the ſinner, quickly, quickly: <hi>Behold I come quickly, Rev.</hi> 22.20. and will then give it thee, and all that long for my appearance, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of his Crowne, which he tels you, is <hi>laid up for him, and all that loves Chriſts ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But thirdly, I meane by Chriſts ſweet knocks, Chriſt telling thee of his Fathers coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell and purpoſe, and of thy being wrapt up in this counſell and purpoſe of God, like time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween eternities; O friend, ſaith Chriſt, my
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:171624:55"/>Father loved thee from all eternity, and choſe thee to him, from all eternity, a veſſell for his own Glory, Name, and Fame, that <hi>thou mights ſhew in ages to come, the exceeding riches of his grace,</hi> Epheſ. 4.5.6.</p>
               <p>O this muſt needs be ſweet indeed, for Chriſt to tell thee of a love before time, and a love out laſting time; yea, all time and ages.</p>
               <p>O when a ſinner fits poring of this love, in reſpect of perſon, God the lover, in reſpect of time, before all worlds; then ſaith he, <hi>O Lord God, what is man that thou art ſo mindfull of him? and what am I, but leſſe then the leaſt of all thy mercies,</hi> as <hi>Iacob</hi> once ſaid, which was of old towards me? And why me, O Lord God, a poore gentile ſinner, a runnagado ſinner, who had neither houſe, nor home, nor grace, nor vertue, but hell, and ſinne, and curſed na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and yet thou loveſt me more then all, and choſe me out of all my neighbours, kindred, houſe, and family, wherein were many ſweet, and many courteous, many wiſe, and many knowing, but none but I choſen, the youngeſt of them all, the pooreſt of them all, the ſinfulleſt of them all, yet I obtained mercy for his purpoſe ſake.</p>
               <p>O ſaith the ſinner, me thinks I even ſee how God rould me in his thoughts, and all the ſonnes of men too; ſaying, this ſhall be a veſſell, and
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:171624:56"/>this ſhall be a veſſell, and this ſhall be another, but theſe I will not uſe, throwing millions by, which were as like as any, if he had pleaſed to uſe them to ſet his mercy off; but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed both mighty ones, and many, and choſe a little remnant, of which my ſoule was one, to ſet his love upon, which hath no height, nor depth, but over-ſpreadeth all, and leaves no roome, to think the ground, or reaſons of it, but onely free-grace, which makes the ſoule ſtill wonder, and leaves him at a loſt, why he ſhould be the man to be exalted ſo, above his fellow creatures, which are alike unto himſelfe, but for free graces ſake, which onely lookt on him, and made him what he is, which makes him ſtud and ſtill to ſay, it is God alone doth all, according to his purpoſe.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, I meane by Chriſts ſweet knocks, his acquainting thee with himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, In reſpect of his love, which thou art by nature more ignorant of, then ever <hi>Ioſephs</hi> Brethren were of him, who eate and drunke with him, but knew him not to be their Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, till teares and bowels ſaid, it was he whom they unkindly ſold.</p>
               <p>The ſinner doth the like, full many a time by Chriſt, when he comes to the heart, and tels them of his dreames, as <hi>Ioſeph</hi> did his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, how they muſt bow to him, and eke ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:171624:56"/>their ſoules unto his yoaks of love, his ſweet and juſt commands; which thing they cannot away with, but huncht him for his newes, by greiving of his Spirit, but Chriſt now makes a famine by wants, and ſtraights, and knocks, and brings them down by need, to ſave their hungry ſoules, which now doe ſee the need of Chriſt, his love and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which he cannot hide from them; but by his ſweet knocks, acquaints them with his love himſelfe, like <hi>Ioſeph</hi> with his bowels.</p>
               <p>And in reſpect of his love, which was and is, beyond all loves; <hi>Greater love,</hi> ſaith Chriſt to the ſinner, <hi>hath no man then this, to lay downe his life for his friend,</hi> but mine is greater. O unkind ſinner, an enemy to me, who loved thee in thy blood, and loved thee in thy ſinne, and hid thee from diſpleaſure, which thou once laidſt liable too, till I in love did free thee; but this thou little mindeſt, nor all my loves for many yeares together, in hunger, cold, and wants, in life, in death, ſtill for thy ſake.</p>
               <p>And thus Chriſt acquaints the ſoule with his love, by his ſweet knocks, and wider opens the ſinners bowels, then ever <hi>Joſeph</hi> did his Brethren.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, I meane by Chriſts ſweet knocks, his acquainting the ſoule with his
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:171624:57"/>lovelineſſe, as well as of his love, which waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us from our ſinnes in his blood, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>O ſaith Chriſt, ſweetly knocking at the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners doore, in a woing way, Sinner, ſinner, behold me, behold me, <hi>my locks are wet with the dew of the night, Cant.</hi> 5.1, <hi>How long ſhall I knock and ſtand? for pitty let me in, I am the roſe of Sharon, the ſweeteſt of ten thouſand, the Lilly of the vallies, the faireſt of ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand; How canſt thou choſe but love me, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner? Behold me, behold me, with the Crowne that my Father crowned me, Proverbs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now for my own ſake ſinner, with my crowne and glory let me in; I am the faireſt, I am the ſweeteſt that ever will come woing to thee; how canſt thou thus deny me, O thou hard hearted ſinner, that ever I met with, to ſtand me out ſo long, who am the roſe, the lilly, and ſtarre of heaven too, which twin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles day and night, and darkens Sun and Moone, which cannot come neere unto me, I am ſo farre, excelling for beauty, light and luſter, and yet ſtill undervalued by thee, O proud and ſcorning ſinner; But yet behold me once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and if thou canſt deny me, I will never try thee more, nor ſhall my ſpirits ſtrive with thee, when as it is in vain; and thus Chriſt acquaints the ſinner of his lovelines, by his ſweet knocks.</p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:171624:57"/>
               <p> But thirdly, Chriſt acquaintes the ſinner with his union, O ſaith Chriſt, I am <hi>Adam</hi> too, <hi>yea fleſh of thy fleſh, and bone of thy bone, thy brother, ſiſter, husband, friend, and father. Matth.</hi> 12.48, 49. Wilt thou deny all theſe relations, and fall below nature, then farewell ſinner, but I am ſtill the ſame, and cannot yet deny my ſelf in no reſpect to thee: O ſtrange, unkind, and forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſinner, of me thy husband, head, and vine in whom thou liveſt, as in thy root, when once thou knoweſt theſe ſweet relations, which are more ſtrong then death, and ſweeter too then ſugred wines, <hi>the honey, or the honey-comb,</hi> yea, <hi>and the roſe of Sharon,</hi> the ſweeteſt in the world.</p>
               <p>But what my union is for ſweetneſſe, it is for time and length, and this I would acquaint thee, O fooliſh, ſimple ſinner.</p>
               <p>And if thou didſt but minde mee in this, how I am one with thee in all conditions, and ſo will be to all eternity, <hi>thy head, and husband, vine and glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But fourthly, I mean by Chriſts ſweet knocks, his acquainting thee of thy union with him, as well as his with thee, by which Chriſt ſaith to the ſinner, <hi>thou art righteous in my righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and comely in my comlineſſe, and ſo farre, faire,</hi> yea, altogether <hi>lovely,</hi> there is no ſpot, nor wrinkle in thee now, none that I can ſee, or my father either. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:171624:58"/>the charge of thee my love, my dove, my undefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led one: it is God that juſtifieth. Rom.</hi> 8.33.5. and I that died, who dares to queſtion thee, <hi>my ſiſter, my Spouſe, my love, my dove, my undefiled one. Cant.</hi> 1.2, 3. If men doe it, it is no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: if ſinne do it, it is no matter: if Angels do it, it is no matter: what if ſin, Satan, men, and devils, Saints, and Angels, all accuſe thee, and thy ſelf too, ſeeing I am he that juſtifieth, all can doe thee no hurt, and therefore be not thou abaſht, for I will bear thee out againſt all. Sin, death, men, and devils, if thou wilt ſtick to me, by beleeving in me: but if thou doſt not, toſſed thou wilt be, and tumbled, foyld thou wilt be, and ſpoild of all thy hopes, and comforts, joy, reſt, and peace, which lyeth in my union with thee, and thine with mee.</p>
               <p>And therefore now ſtick to me, for I will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, lets ſee, who dares condemne, for I am <hi>he that juſtifieth,</hi> in ſpite of men, and divels, <hi>all that comes to me, and beleeveth in me,</hi> and will do ſo ſtill, while my name is Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, I know it is Chriſt, by the place, he knocks at the doore, which is the heart of the ſinner. Well, what of that, firſt it is the moſt ſecret and retired part of man: a place indeed which none can ſpeak to, but Chriſt, I have had ere now many ſpeak to my eare, but never any but Chriſt could ſpeak to my heart: many would
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:171624:58"/>ſpeak to my eare, but that <hi>I</hi> little regarded; now Chriſt ſpeaks to my heart, and this <hi>I</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but weigh.</p>
               <p>Light things were ſpoken to my eare. O but Chriſt ſpeaks ſerious things to my heart, things concerning Gods glory, things concerning my ſoule; yea, the everlaſting welfare of it. O this hearts ſpeaking muſt be weighed, O this hearts ſpeaking muſt be conſidered: it is as much as my life is worth; yea, it is as much as my ſoule is worth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> have heretofore heard talke of Chriſt, <hi>I</hi> have heretofore read of Chriſt, I have heretofore diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of Chriſt; O but <hi>I</hi> never till now, knew what it was indeed to hear Chriſt, or ſpeak with Chriſt, or converſe with Chriſt either, nor thouſands in the world as well as <hi>I,</hi> that would be thought good chriſtians, and do paſſe for good chriſtians by many.</p>
               <p>O but now, to my comfort, <hi>I</hi> taſte him, now <hi>I</hi> ſee him, now <hi>I</hi> feele him, now <hi>I</hi> enjoy him, and from this taſting, ſeeing, feeling, and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, my ſoule is raviſhed, my heart is warmed, <hi>I am now filled with marrow and fatneſſe. Pſalm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Let him kiſſe me with the kiſſes of his mouth, for his love is better then wine. Cant.</hi> 11. <hi>v.</hi> 1. <hi>Yea, then life it ſelfe,</hi> ſo ſaith <hi>David. I will now ſing of my beloved, he is the lilly among the valleys. Cant.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>Hee is the roſe of
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:171624:59"/>Sharon, he is white and ruddy, the faireſt of ten thouſand. Cant.</hi> 5.10. The chiefeſt of ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, the ſweetneſt of ten thouſand; for beauty, love, and ſweetneſſe, there is none that can come neere him.</p>
               <p>They are mad that minde him not, they are mad that know him not, they are mad that ſeek him not; did men know as I do, did men ſee as I do, and enjoy as I doe; they would ſay as I ſay, they would ſing as I ſing.</p>
               <p>Thou, O Chriſt, art beautifull, thou, O Chriſt, art ſweet, thou, O Chriſt, art lovely; yea, alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether lovely; thou, O Chriſt, art all, yea, ſtil I ſay, thou art all: all for beauty, all for pleaſure, all for profit, all for ſweetneſſe, pure divine ſweetneſſe, yea, they would cry out, thou art all, thou art all, thou art all, O Chriſt.</p>
               <p>At all times, in all places, and conditions, all in wants, all in ſtraights, all in peace and plenty, all in bondage, all in fredome, all in health, all in ſickneſſe, making health by thy preſence.</p>
               <p>O Chriſt, I ſay no more, but thou art all in life, <hi>and he that hath thee ſhall never die. John</hi> 4.10. &amp; <hi>John</hi> 11.26.27. <hi>but ſhall live for ever with thee,</hi> and therefore thou art all, O Chriſt, <hi>all in life, all in death, and eternity too.</hi> 3. <hi>Col. v.</hi> 11.</p>

Chriſt was ſo revealed to <hi>Iſaiah</hi> that foretold all, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt he die, or ſuffered; his riding to <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> and the manner of it; <hi>Mary Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> ſhall conceive of Chriſt, by the power of the moſt high, over ſhadowing her, and in her armes ſhall carry him that made the world, her God and Saviour, from place to place. <hi>Paul</hi> was ſtrook to the ground by Chriſt, after taken up into the heavens, with ſeeing ſuch things that was unutterable: So <hi>John</hi> ſees here the Throne of God, the Glory of God, the River of Life, the Tree of Life.</p>
               <p>Secondly, All glorious diſcoveries are of Chriſt, and the Spirit; <hi>He ſhewed me the River of life;</hi> yea, all my revelations: as <hi>chap.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 1. and therefore it is called, <hi>The revelations which God gave by Ieſus Chriſt, to ſhew unto his Servants;</hi> of which it is ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed is he that readeth, and he that heareth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I come to the words, and will open them, or at leaſt will hint ſomething from them,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:171624:60"/>according to my weake, and glimmering light.</p>
               <p>And firſt, We have the riſe of this River, and that is the Throne of God and of the Lambe, which I conceive to be his own ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting glory, in which he dwels and lives; or otherwiſe, the glorious union of the divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which ſets up one another, as a Throne, a Prince; the Father ſets up the Sonne, the Sonne reveales the Father, the Spirit ſets up, and is ſent forth by both, which is the River.</p>
               <p>Secondly, For the nature of this River, It is pure, <hi>He ſhewed me a pure river of water:</hi> ſo ſaith <hi>David, With thee is the well of life ſo pure;</hi> this River is pure, pure indeed.</p>
               <p>Firſt, In its nature and riſe, it proceeded from the pure fountaine of Gods Glory, or the Throne of God and the Lambe; and ſo it is pure for nature.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is pure for operation, it puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth where it runneth, and ſo it is like the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finers fire, and fullers ſope, purifying the ſonnes of <hi>Levi,</hi> which is by waſhing them in the blood of Chriſt, and leading them in, and by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is cleare, yea, ſo cleare, as it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be compared to any thing but the Chryſtall: O the Chryſtall ſtone, it is the cleareſt of all
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:171624:61"/>ſtones, Diamonds are darke and cloudy many, but the Chriſtall ſtone, it is the cleareſt of all; you may ſee through, and through it; ſo cleare is this River, you may ſee through and through all eternities by it; from eternity to eternity, and myſtery to myſtery; Chriſt in earth, Chriſt in glory, Chriſt in fleſh, Chriſt in ſpirit, and all cleare; <hi>We with open face, behold the glory of God, as in a glaſſe, and are changed from glory to glory,</hi> but by the ſpirit of the Lord, the River from the Throne.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>He ſhewed me a pure river of life;</hi> I, <hi>that is the well of life,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> 36.8 Here is the excellency of this river, it is a living river, and a life-giving river: ſo ſaith Chriſt, <hi>He that ſhall drinke of this water that I ſhall give him,</hi> meaning this river, <hi>ſhall never thirſt againe, but ſhall have a living ſatisfaction in it, and out of his belly ſhall flow rivers of living wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> O the worth of this living river, this life-giving river, endleſſe life and glory; Glorious things are ſpoken of thee, O City of God; ſo may I ſay of thee, O River of God, <hi>whoſe ſtreames refreſh the City of God, Pſal.</hi> 46.4. Well, I know yee perceive by this, what this river, this living river, ſo pure and cleare as Chriſtall, flowing from the Throne of God, and the Lambe, as proceeding from both, ſent forth by both, to water the Paradice of God,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:171624:61"/>yea, every plant and tree, eſpecially thoſe that want moſt.</p>
               <p>Well, are you ſatisfied what this river means, that <hi>John</hi> tells you is ſo pure, ſo clear; I beleeve you are: but take this Scripture too however, <hi>John</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 37. <hi>in the laſt day, the great day of the feaſt, Jeſus ſtood up, ſaying, if any man thirſt, let him come unto me, and drinke, and out of his belly ſhall flow rivers of living water,</hi> and this ſpake he of the Spirit which they ſhould receive, beleeving in him. <hi>Hearken O heavens, heare O earth, give eare O ye inhabitants of the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O what a proclamation is here for you, from a ſweet and bountifull Chriſt, to a poore and thirſty ſinner, what <hi>the river of life</hi> to any one, high, low, rich, poor, yong, old, bond, free; yea, any one that will come by beleeving. O free, O bountifull Chriſt, inviting ſinners to a river, yea, a living river to drinke their fils; and yet a drop is more worth then ten thouſand rivers of oyle; yea, the oyle of ſpices, yea, the ſweeteſt ſpices. O chriſtian friend, here is the well of life indeed, here is the fountaine of life indeed, here is the river of pleaſure, I, and the ſweeteſt pleaſure too lies in this ſtreame: for it is the river of life endleſſe, endleſſe life, and glory.</p>
               <p>And heare now, O ye ſons of men, how loud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Chriſt calls poore ſinners to come to this <hi>Chryſtall river;</hi> in the Scriptures before, <hi>John</hi>

               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:171624:62"/>
               <p> O friends, Chriſt proclaimes both lands and livings, jewels, crowns, and kingdomes; nay, more, ten thouſand times more: <hi>a river of life, and glory,</hi> and men will ſcarcely ſtirre: ariſe, ariſe ſots, and heare, if you be not deaf, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not. O the Spirit invites, and bids you come too, the eternall Spirit of God, one with God, the third perſon in the Trinity of God; ſhall this eternall Spirit of God, one with God, comming down from God, inviting you in the name of God, and for your own ſoules ſake, to accept of <hi>this river of God,</hi> ſent forth by God, for the glory of God, ſhall this invitation he ſlighted.</p>
               <p>O, muſt not this be a high contempt of God, and a great afront to the Spirit of God, ſent to thee by God, ſo to be ſlighted? O thou ſlighting, careleſſe, fooliſh ſinner.</p>
               <p>Sinner, this contempt of the Spirits invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, may coſt thee thy ſoule: thy ſoule, I ſay, thy everliving ſoule, if thou doſt not quickly minde it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>the Bride bids you come, the Lambs wife, the Spouſe of Chriſt,</hi> united to Chriſt, being married with Chriſt, by the Spirit of Chriſt, in faith, divine love, and ſweet obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Chriſt. O ſhe hath drunk <hi>of this river,</hi> well may ſhe ſay, <hi>come all that will come, come,</hi> ſhe knowes by experience, this to be <hi>the river of life and pleaſure,</hi> and therefore ſhe ſaith come
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:171624:63"/>away, come away, or elſe you die, you die; and now, O every one that will come, come; Chriſt loudly calls you, and the Spirit ſtill invites you, <hi>and the Bride</hi> would faine perſwade you, from her own experience that ſhe hath of this river, why will you not then come away, and take <hi>the water of life,</hi> you may have it if you will, now take it freely: ſo ſaith, <hi>the Bride and the Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now friends, ye ſee what this river is, how freely you may have it: yea, you, I meane, the worſt of ſinners: come away then, come away, and drinke abundantly; come, I ſay, for the name of God, come and drink.</p>
               <p>For the name of God, what is that?</p>
               <p>His goodneſſe, and his kindneſſe, his unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able goodneſſe, his tranſcendent goodneſſe, his infinite goodneſſe, O for this his goodneſſe ſake come and drink; for the name of Chriſt, come and drinke.</p>
               <p>For the name of Chriſt, what is that?</p>
               <p>His love, his love, his bleeding love, his dying love, his living love, his eternall love. O for Chriſt, &amp; his loves ſake, ſinners, come away, for the name, and ſake of the Spirit, come and drink.</p>
               <p>The name of the Spirit, what is that?</p>
               <p>His freeing name, his ſealing name, his comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, &amp; ſweet name, his leading name, his pleading name ſake, come away, O ſinner, in the name of
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:171624:63"/>God, and for the ſake of God, Chriſt, and the Spirit, come and drinke. O ſinner, I ſhould invite thee too for thine own ſoules ſake: but what is that to God, Chriſt, and the Spirits ſake: but ſtay, me thinks I heare one ſay, what is it to drinke <hi>of this river of life.</hi> Firſt, it is to delight your ſelves in it; yea, drinke for delight as well as for thirſt.</p>
               <p>O then, ye ſonnes of men, why will ye not come hither, that your ſoules might be delighted with draughts of <hi>living water.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, yea, drinke to quench your thirſt, O come, and quench your thirſt in this pleaſant river; yea, quench all kinds of thirſt in your ſoules: your thirſts for profits, pleaſures, and contents, come quench them here, for here you may, and no where elſe: men who have runne to creatures to quench their thirſty ſoules, have found them all a lie, and ſo will you too, who run, and call for creature waters, to quench their feveriſh ſoules.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, ye drink to coole your ſelves, come hither, drinke, drinke, and then ye ſhall lay all your heates, your worldly heates, your luſtfull heates, your ſinfull heats.</p>
               <p>O thou laborious <hi>Worldling,</hi> thy bottle will be empty, what ſhall thy ſoul then do, when death, like night comes on thee, I ſay, what will you doe. O me thinks, I heare thee even crying out,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:171624:64"/>drink, drink, or elſe I die, I die.</p>
               <p>Why doe you not give me drink, but let me thus lye burning, and dying too, for thirſt of that which once was freely offered to mee, but now cannot be bought with prayers, teares, nor cryes, nor all my worldly riches, which I once overvalued, and thirſted after, more then God, Chriſt, or heaven; have you never heard dying worldlings thus complain? ſurely you have: why doe you not that are alive, and living come then unto this river, and drink of this ſame wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and thee I would too, who art heated with luſt, with burning luſt of uncleanneſſe, pride, paſſion, and ſuch like fiery diſtempers burning in thy ſoul as if hell fire was already kindled in thee.</p>
               <p>O friends, thoſe luſts which lye ſo ſecret ſmothering in thy ſoule, will one day breake forth into dreadfull flames, burning round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout thee. Have you never ſeen a dying ſinner diſpairing of mercy, lie in the midſt of theſe flames burning, and diſpairing, and no friend able to bring him any comfort, no not in the leaſt.</p>
               <p>Againe, ye drink for comfort, to comfort your hearts: but poore hearts, know this, there is no true comfort but in God, Chriſt, and the river, and unleſſe you come to this river of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, this ſoul-comforting water of life, ye ſhall
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:171624:64"/>live comfortleſſe, ye ſhall die comfortleſſe, and be damnd for want of it.</p>
               <p>God hath decreed, true comfort ſhall be no where, but in himſelf, his Son, and river. <hi>John</hi> 15.26. ye know, Chriſt promiſed his Diſciples a comforter, and what was that Comforter, I pray, but the Spirit, and the river mentioned.</p>
               <p>O me thinks, I might perſwade you to this river, a drop, a drop of it will ſweeten any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; art thou poore, ſick, weak, what ayleſt thou man, take a drop, take a drop of this river, I will warrant you comfort? but here I would invite, and not diſcourage, for a world, ſuch poor Chriſtians, that are heated with tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and corruptions, that they goe mourning and ſighing by reaſon hereof, and Satans temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations filling them with feares and doubts, that they cry out like <hi>David, O, I ſhall one day periſh by corruption and temptation,</hi> ſuch a corruption ſayes one, and ſuch a corruption ſayes another, me thinks they grow ſtronger and ſtronger, and I feare at laſt will be my ruine.</p>
               <p>O my friend, let me tell thee two things, and doe thou remember them.</p>
               <p>Firſt, no ſoule is damnd for the preſence of ſin, but for the love of ſin; marke me, I ſay, it is not the preſence of ſin, but the love of ſin, that damns.</p>
               <p>My ſecond word is this to thee, O com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:171624:65"/>ſinner; ſinne flutters moſt, when it hath its deaths wound, as ſoon as Chriſts comes into our hearts, he wounds ſinne to the heart, as I may ſo ſay, by giving a ſight of it, a diſlike and hatred to it.</p>
               <p>Well, thus Chriſt wounds ſinne, and it may be now, ſinne like ſome fowle, whoſe necke is broken, beats the wing, and flutters, as if it were, alive; well, ſo doth ſinne, whoſe neck Chriſt hath broken in the ſoule, beates the wing and fluters, keepes more ſputter now then ever.</p>
               <p>Well friend, remember theſe ſputterings are the death pangs of ſinne, I, the death pangs; and be but patient, thou ſhalt plainly ſee them to be no otherwiſe, and therefore doe not fill thy heart with feares of ruine, for it ſhall never be, for thou like <hi>David</hi> ſhalt overcome <hi>Saul</hi> thine enemy; I meane corruption; but in the meane time come away to the river, drinke, drinke, and it will ſtrengthen thee and coole thee.</p>
               <p>O but now me thinks I heare ſome ſoule ſay, I would drinke with all my heart, but I am an unworthy, poore ſinner. O friend, the more poore, the more worthy to Chriſt; art thou poore, then goe to Chriſts doore, <hi>he feeds the poore, but the rich he ſends empty away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe, Thou art unworthy; What doſt thou meane by unworthy? Thou ſeeſt no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:171624:65"/>why Chriſt ſhould give thee the water of life, nor the Spirit; I beleeve thou doſt not; I verily beleeve thou art unworty in thy ſelf, and cannot ſee any reaſon, why Chriſt ſhould give thee the water of life.</p>
               <p>But, Friend, know, there is a worthyneſſe in Chriſt, and ſo thou mayſt be worthy, or any poore ſinner, who layes hold on Chriſts worthyneſſe, and ſo goes to the Father in the worthyneſſe of the Son, for the water of life, and the river.</p>
               <p>But to be plaine with thee, thou art indeed a proud ſinner, thou art proud, I ſay, and art aſhamed to have this water of life on Chriſts owne termes freely, but wouldſt faine buy the river, by a worthyneſſe in thy ſelfe; O let me ſee thee, let me ſee thy face, ô covetous man.</p>
               <p>What wouldſt thou buy Chriſts purchaſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his head? that is the plaine engliſh of it, get thee gone, O proud ſinner, and come againe beggar-like, with a Bottle and a Diſh, that is, a a poore, empty and unworthy ſoule; this is the way man, if thou meanſt to ſpeed; for tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I think, for a ſinner to bring any thing of his own worthyneſſe to God and Chriſt, is as great a ſinne, as thou canſt commit, this is an affronting ſinne, it affronts God and Chriſt, as if they were ſellers of the water of life, which they can as freely give to a thirſty ſoule, as raine to the thirſty ground.</p>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:171624:66"/>
               <p> What coſt, or charge, or labour, is it for God, to raine downe ſhowers, to water the earth, when it lyes gaping for it? I ſay, it is no charge, or labour to God, who hath his clouds and bottles full; and a word from God, and they ſtraight ſhower down, and doe not give over till they have ſatisfied the dry ground; ſo truly can, and will God, raine down this wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of life, to a poore and thirſty ſoule gaping for it; <hi>When the poore and needy cry for wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and there is none, I the Lord will heare, Iſaiah</hi> 41.</p>
               <p>But againe, I ſay as at firſt, this is an affront to God and Chriſt, to bring any thing for a paile, yea, a ſoule full of the water of life, it is the high-way to overturne his free grace, which God will have exalted above the heavens, and that it might be known in the earth; he freely ſent, yea gave, his Sonne, unſought uncravd and will he ſell the river, thinke you, that is purchaſed by his Sonne? doe not thinke ſo, it overturnes the glory of his free grace, freely offered unto all, that freely will accept it; and this was Gods deſigne, to make his glory known unto the ſons of men, which they have little minded; I ſay, the deſigne of God from all eternity, was to ſet up his name, his free grace, in giving Chriſt the bread of life, and the Spirit the water of life, freely to the ſonnes of men,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:171624:66"/>
                  <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.48.32.33: and 48.9.10. <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.20.21. <hi>Iohn</hi> 7.37.</p>
               <p>O, God delights to make all his attributes known, his Juſtice, Power, Wiſdome. But the glory of his grace, freely giving Chriſt and the Spirit.</p>
               <p>This is that which eſpecially, he would have exalted in the world, and the ſonnes of men admire him in God would be admired for his bounty, to give ſo like himſelfe a Chriſt, a River of life freely; I ſay, God thinks not much to give all this, for the magnifying of his free grace, that his bounty and himſelfe might be admired, and we the ſonnes of men, cry out and ſay, who, <hi>who is a God like unto thee? that pardons iniquity by forgiving iniquity, tranſgreſſion and ſinne, giving life, Chriſt, and the Spirit freely.</hi> Now I ſay, this was Gods deſigne Before all worlds, and for this deſignes ſake, even the glory of his grace, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 16. he gives his Sonne and Spirit freely.</p>
               <p>Now when a Soul will not come to God, nor accept of God, his Sonne, the Spirit freely, but would bring ſome kind of worthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for his Sonne, and river: thou over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneſt this grace, ſhearly overturneſt it; O what a fearfull thing is this to buy Chriſts river, I tell thee, thou buying Chriſtian,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:171624:67"/>Chriſt will not ſell one drop for Iewels, Gold, nor Silver, for he bought to give, and thou talkſt of buying by ſo much repentance, tears, and I know not what.</p>
               <p>O but now me thinks, I heare ſome poore ſoule ſay, I ſee no worthyneſſe in my ſelfe, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther looke I after a worthyneſſe, or expect to have a drop of the river of life, for any wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyneſſe of my owne; I loath my ſelfe, and condemne my ſelfe, for I finde my ſelfe wholly carnall, fold under ſinne, and in the ſelfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning way, have I like a Beggar waited at Chriſts doore, for the bread and water of life, praying and craving Chriſt for it, night and day; but I am ſtill unſerved, and yet I ſee thouſands ſerved, who have not waited half ſo long as I.</p>
               <p>Well friend, Beggers muſt be ſo ſerved, that they may learne how to wait; if you give a Beggar, he like a Fidler, ſtraight is gone, and many have ſerved Chriſt ſo; ſometimes for a creature comfort, for a ſupply of helpe in time of need, for a wife, for a childe, ſometimes gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by Chriſt, ſometimes ſpared by Chriſt, from death in ſickneſſe, which as ſoon as Chriſt hath given them, they ſtraight runne away, and ſcarce ſay, I thank you Chriſt, but runne ſtraight away, till they know not what to doe for another ſuch like Almes, and Friend:
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:171624:67"/>many ſerve Chriſt ſo, <hi>for the river of life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O, they would faine have <hi>the water of life,</hi> and are night and day at Chriſts doore, by prayers, ſermons, &amp;c. When Chriſt hath once ſerved them with a prettie deale of aſſurance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the river, and their ſoules, theſe beggars ſtraight are gone away into the worlds cares, and pleaſures, where Chriſt heares no more of them for the river, nor nothing elſe a long time after: but this Chriſt takes very unkindly from them, that they ſhould, as ſoon as ever their own turn is ſerved by Chriſt, come no more at Chriſt, till ſome great neceſſitie even drives them: and it may be Chriſt ſees thee, that thou wouldſt ſerve him ſo too, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore makes thee wait a little: a little do you call it, when I have waited whilſt many have been ſerved, and ſome that I know very well; but I am ſtill unſerved.</p>
               <p>Wel friend, do not be angry, if Chriſt makes the laſt firſt, &amp; the firſt laſt, by this they all learn to wait Chriſts leaſure, which is a leſſon, he wil teach his poore, who beg for the bread of life, the river of life: and ſuch things I ſay he will learne them all; I, all to wait his leaſure, firſt or laſt.</p>
               <p>But ſtay my friend, it may be thou art ſerved already, I have ſeen beggars well ſerved, and yet begging preſently after, as if they were
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:171624:68"/>ſtarved, it may be thou doeſt do ſo about the river, let me ask thee one queſtion, and anſwer me truely: have you never had no bread, nor water from Chriſt at no time?</p>
               <p>Yes, I muſt confeſſe the truth, and will, ſeeing you put me to it; I was one time very earneſtly begging in my cloſet all alone, by prayer, and then Chriſt indeed, gave me a good draught of <hi>the water of life, the bread of life,</hi> I mean the Spirit, which ſatisfied me for two or three dayes, and made my heart very lightſom, and chearfull; And I will tell you of another time, when I was at a ſermon where I got a ſup and a bit too: for he was ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king how freely Chriſt did give poore ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners <hi>the river of life, the well of life,</hi> the Spirit inviting thirſty ſinners; crying, come, come to me ye weary ſinners, ye thirſty ſinners, and ſo forth, and then he was ſpeaking of that of <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 3, 4. <hi>Bleſſed are they that thirſt for Chriſt, and mourne for ſinne:</hi> which my ſoul then did, and truely, this proved a great deal of comfort to mee.</p>
               <p>But I remember many a time beſides this, I have had much comfort by the word: when mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters have clearly opened the Goſpel-promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: but ſometimes; yea, many times, I hear ſuch ſweet Goſpel-texts, and precious things held from them, which hath filled me, even as with
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:171624:68"/>marrow, and fatneſſe, and I haue even thought with my ſelfe, all theſe comforts held forth by them, belong to mee.</p>
               <p>But as ſoone, as hee had held forth his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, now ſaith he, I will give you ſome markes, and ſignes, how a poore ſoule may know this belongs to him.</p>
               <p>I remember, I gave great attention to him, but before he had done with his marks, and ſignes; I had loſt my comfort againe, by thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, none of it, belongs to me: for I had not ſo repented me of my ſins, as he ſhewed me.</p>
               <p>True repentance there to be, which he ſaid, was a turning from all ſinne to Chriſt, and a forſaking of all my ſinne for Chriſt, and a ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for all my ſinnes, by which I had diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured Chriſt: This one mark, he did ſo abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly branch out, that before hee had done with this one mark and ſigne of that ſinner, to whom this comfort belongs, I had loſt my comfort. I am ſure: but he went to twenty more marks and ſignes, I think, and at laſt ſaid, if theſe marks and fignes be in you, then theſe comforts belong unto you: but if they be not, then you deceive your ſelves: but in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, he ſaid indeed, if wee would repent, and waſh away our ſinnes by that, like <hi>David,</hi> forſake all our ſinnes, and bring our whole hearts to Chriſt, and denie the world, the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:171624:69"/>pleaſures, and profits of the world, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance more which <hi>I</hi> cannot now ſtand to name; but all this <hi>I</hi> am ſure, he bad me, and others to do, before we did preſume to lay hold of any comfort, ſo that whereas <hi>I</hi> was in hopes of being comforted, <hi>I</hi> was not; but rather caſt down: but at ſome other time Chriſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved me freely with comfort from his word, for which <hi>I</hi> bleſſe his name, and thus <hi>I</hi> have told you, what comfort Chriſt hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me ere now.</p>
               <p>But yet, <hi>I</hi> will tell you of one or two wayes more, by which Chriſt uſes to come, and ſerve mee with comfort, giving the water of life to mee.</p>
               <p>One way in Chriſtian meetings, commonly called, conventicles heretofore: but <hi>I</hi> have in theſe meetings, found much of Chriſt, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to my poore ſoule: at our laſt meeting, <hi>I</hi> think, there was ſome twenty of us, all met in a friends houſe, purpoſely to diſcourſe of Chriſt, and wait on Chriſt, expecting all comfort from Chriſt, and whilſt we were ſpeaking, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſing of Chriſt in that place, <hi>I</hi> think verily, we were every one refreſhed, onely by telling how Chriſt uſeth to ſerve us, ſometimes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, and ſometimes not at all: but ſeemed to be angry with us, for asking ſome carnall things; ſo at laſt, wee found many things
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:171624:69"/>Chriſt would never grant to any of us, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeemed to frown upon us, for asking ſome things which we had all been a craving of him: ſo at that time we conſidered, what might be got by begging, and parted; but this <hi>I</hi> do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, a ſcoffing <hi>Iſhmael</hi> called it a tub preaching.</p>
               <p>And one time, which <hi>I</hi> ſhall never forget, I was walking all alone by Chriſts doore, in a way of meditation of his bounty, love, and frankneſſe to ſuch poore fellowes as I, and while I was walking, thinking nothing, God knows: Chriſt ſtept out, and puld me in, ſet me down, and himſelf by me, and ſupt with me; we had whole flagons of wine then, of which I drank very freely, and I dare ſay, I ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver forget this bout. So the next day, I told half a dozen Chriſtians, waiting at Chriſts door in a ſermon, how I had ſped the day before, they bade me, thank God, ſaying, they had never ſuch good fortune, nor ſuch diſcoveries of Chriſts love.</p>
               <p>Friend, friend, I rejoyce to heare theſe ſweet relations of your experience: but let me tell you, <hi>I</hi> am aſhamed, and ſo may you well be; but however, <hi>I</hi> am, to think how you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaind, nay, murmured but now, and ſaid, Chriſt had never ſerved you of the water of life, but you had waited ſo long, and ſo long, and <hi>I</hi>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:171624:70"/>cannot tell how long you made me beleeve, &amp; how Chriſt had ſerved thouſands, and not you.</p>
               <p>Friend, I am aſhamed to thinke, how you have abuſed Chriſt, by your falſe complaints of Chriſt; ſurely it is a great ſinne in you, I pray, doe ſo no more.</p>
               <p>But now mee thinks I heare one ſay, but I am a poore thirſty ſoule, I doe not know when in prayer, ſermon, chriſtian conference, either I was ſo refreſhed, and therefore what would you have me doe, who am even ſcorcht with heat and thirſt, I thirſt for Chriſt, and would rather have him, then the world a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times, if I know my own heart.</p>
               <p>What would you have me doe, doſt thou ſay? Let me tell thee, firſt, how well I like this complaint of thine; Surely by this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of thine, and the high priſing of this ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, it doth argue his ſtreames, ſtrongly running in thy ſoule.</p>
               <p>Yea, let me tell thee my thoughts; This I doe beleeve, tis from the preſence of Chriſt and the Spirit in the ſoule, that any ſoule living, is drawne forth to deſire Chriſt, or the Spirit; you know the naturall man, deſires not the things of God, but is dead to every good worke, or deſire, and ſure cannot indeed deſire any thing in a ſpirituall way, before God workes it in his ſoule. Now friend, if God,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:171624:70"/>or Chriſt hath wrought a ſtrong deſire after the well of life, the river of life, the ſpirit; let me tell thee, I verily beleeve he hath given it thee already; for this deſire in thy ſoule, is to me a ſtrong evidence of it.</p>
               <p>I, for my part, doe firmly conclude, when I heare any ſoule complaine for want of Chriſt, and the Spirit, ſaying, of Chriſt and the Spirit, his ſoule had rather have Chriſt and the Spirit, then all the pleaſures, profits of the world, I ſay, I doe conclude this to be the work of God in the ſoule.</p>
               <p>This is true, a naturall man may have a heart quame, and a heart wiſh to die the death of the righteous, as wicked <hi>Balaam</hi> once ſaid, <hi>O that I might die the death of the righteous, and that my laſt end may be like theirs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſay, A wicked man may deſire to bee ownd of Chriſt, nay more, to give all the world for Chriſt at the laſt hower, when they come to ſee a neceſſity, and their ſouls damn'd for want of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>O how will a carnall man dying, mourn, and beg, and cry for Chriſt, and howl for Chriſt too, though all in vain; but as theſe men have lived without him all their lives, ſo muſt they die without him too; for I believe he will ſcarce own the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> now, who never regarded him before; but yet as I ſaid at firſt, ſo I doe conclude, there
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:171624:71"/>is comfort, yea, abundant deale of comfort belongs to thy ſoule, or any ſoule in thy condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and for this read <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 41.17.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When the poore and needy ſeek water, and there is none, and their tongue faileth for thirſt, I the Lord will heare them, and I will open Rivers in the tops of Hils, and Fountaines in the midſt of the Valleys, and in her Wilderneſſe make pools of water, &amp; her waſte places Springs of water.</hi> Marke this ſweet and full promiſe, <hi>when the poore and needy ſeeke water, and there is none, their tongues cleaveth for thirſt:</hi> Friend, this Promiſe is to thee, as ſure as the Lord lives, and ſuch as thee: for marke, <hi>when the poore and needy ſeek water;</hi> art not thou poor, yes, it was thy very objection againſt thy ſelfe.</p>
               <p>O, ſaidſt thou, I am a poore ſoule, and doe not know when I dranke of the water of life, and ſo forth. Well, thy very complaint doth argue thee a needy ſoule, yea, thou ſeeſt the need of Chriſt, yea, abſolute need of Chriſt, for thou ſeeſt thy ſoule undone without him, and this need of Chriſt, makes thee ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine after Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Well, Is it not ſo; yes truly, <hi>my ſoule ſtands in need of Chriſt, and is a thirſt,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>Yea, it panteth for Chriſt, like the Heart after the water Brooks in a
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:171624:71"/>barren wilderneſſe, ſo panteth my ſoule after him, whom my ſoule thirſteth for.</hi> Truly friend, you muſt learne to beleeve that, that ſhall be, which ſeemes moſt unlikely to be, ſo did <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, he beleeved in hope againſt hope, and obtained the promiſe.</hi> O poore complaining ſinner, beleeve this promiſe of God to thy ſoul, ſo much againſt hope and reaſon; <hi>I</hi> ſay, beleeve God will not onely give thee the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thou deſireſt of him, but <hi>will open rivers of water in the tops of the Hils and Fountains in the valleys.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well friend, you ſee here is Gods Promiſe to open up to a ſoul, a river of water in Chriſt, <hi>who is the hill of our ſalvation;</hi> therefore ſaith <hi>David, I will looke to the hils, from whence commeth my ſalvation,</hi> or, <hi>I will open rivers in the tops of the hils,</hi> that is, <hi>I</hi> think poore ſoules that are as far from any ſprings of conſolation, as tops of hils are from ſprings of water, but <hi>I</hi> will open fountains in low grounds, or ſpirits in humble ſoules, that is the vallies here meant.</p>
               <p>O friend, beleeve thou this, that the Lord will open fountaines of living water, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king peace, or joy, or comfort, flow like living fountaines in thy ſoule; <hi>I</hi> ſay, beleeve this Promiſe, which ſhall be fulfilled in its ſeaſon, and then ſhalt thou ſing and ſay, <hi>Sing yee waſte places of the earth, for the Lord hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:171624:72"/>his people by making her wilderneſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Pool, and her waſt land ſprings of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But why is the Spirit compared to a river, <hi>I Iohn ſaw a pure river of water,</hi> Why is it, for theſe and ſuch like reaſons I think.</p>
               <p>Firſt reaſon is, a river is ſtrong and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, no ſtopping a river, but it will over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow: yee know, if yee ſtop a river, it will do ſo, ſo are the workings of Gods Spirit in his people, ſee in <hi>Daniel</hi> in whom they would have ſtopped the Spirit of prayer by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly decree of the King, but ſee how <hi>Daniels</hi> ſpirit riſes like a River, and now he will call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his God with more boldneſſe then before. Many would have in our dayes dammed up this river by a Form of prayer, but O theſe men are drownd; theſe fooliſh men are carried clean away, like dry leaves by a mighty Land-flood, and what the Spirit is in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, the ſame it is in preaching to a ſtrong river; ſee in <hi>Peter,</hi> who was forbid by the Scribes and Phariſees to preach Chriſt; but ſaith he, <hi>I cannot but muſt ſpeak the things of Chriſt.</hi> Many have in our dayes paid dear for their boldneſſe this way.</p>
               <p>Secondly, how powerfull is this river in its conviction, when it runs in a way of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering Sin and wrath, who can ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:171624:72"/>it, truly none: it bears down young and old ſtrong and ſtout, yea, oakes and ceders, as well as ſtrawes. Doth this ſpirit like a flood beare away, when it runs in a way of convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? See in the Gaoler who, I am perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded was a ſtubborn crabbed knave: ſee how he abuſeth the poore Diſciples over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night even fleaed the skin off their backs; well, the ſame night the flood breaks in upon his Spirit, and he cryes out, <hi>what ſhall I do to be ſaved?</hi> to the Diſciples. Poore ſouls, they tell this fellow, notwithſtanding their uſage, how he may eſcape drowning by wrath and ſinne: and ſo <hi>Paul</hi> was overturned by this river, and carried back to <hi>Damaſcus</hi> like a dead drownd man, yea ſo ſuddenly did this river break in upon his ſpirit, that he was turned by it, like a ſtraw in a whirlwind.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, a river is powerfull in its progreſs, a river is of that nature, that it beats down all dammes ye can throw up, or elſe over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow as I ſaid before, &amp;c. So did the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles bear down al oppoſition from threats and ſcorns, ſcoffes, whips, ſtones, and the like.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, a river is pleaſant, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful, ye chuſe a river ſide to walk by, whoſe ſtreames with ſilence, ſweetly glides trinkling along, and makes the walk delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, ſo is the Spirit in its diſcoveries, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:171624:73"/>in ſuch as theſe. Firſt the love of Chriſt which is ſeen paſſing by this river, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther looking in this river, where you ſee his love like a circle, and your Souls in the midſt, where is no way in nor out, I ſay by the Spirit ye ſhall ſee ſuch a love; a love from eternity to eternity, thy Soul looking both wayes, like <hi>Janus</hi> two faces, eſpecially for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
               <p>But as his love, ſo his lovelineſſe the ſpirit ſtreaming in the ſoul, preſents Chriſt over, and over to the Soul. Chriſt rides in this river, as in a barge of State, whoſe various ſtreams ſweetly rowes him up and down. The ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of his Saints like a Princes in her barge of pleaſure, O how lovely is Chriſt in the Soul, when in his glory diſcovered to the Soul by the Spirit, then is he indeed the faireſt of ten thouſand, the chiefeſt of ten thouſand, the ſweeteſt of ten thouſand, yea altogether lovely.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it ſhows you your union to, which you may ſee walking by this river, yea, all your relations to Chriſt, and his to you, he the vine, you the branches, he the head, you the members, he the husband, you the ſpouſe. I ſay, this union you may ſee by the Spirit, the ſtrength, length, glory and ſweetneſſe of it, O ſaith the Spirit, thy union is ſtrong, O
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:171624:73"/>Chriſtian, nothing can diſſolve or untie it; men cannot, Devils cannot, ſinne cannot, nay death it ſelf cannot, it is ſtronger then all, ſinne, death, men or devils, and as long as ſtrong it was from eternitie to eternitie, from eternitie intentionally to all eternitie reallie, but it is more ſweet, ſaith the Spirit, then ſtrong or long. O the ſweetneſſe of all unions is but glimpſe of this union. What is the Father to the Son? the husband to the wife? but a ſhadow of Chriſt to the Soul; yea, all relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with all the ſweetneſſe of them, and all the ſweetneſſe in them is but as a drop to this ocean of ſweetneſſe, Chriſts union with the Saints.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the uſefullneſſe of Chriſt to the Soul, <hi>without me ſaith Chriſt, ye can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> to his Diſciples, Chriſt is all in the Soul, and all to the Soul. A Chriſtian can neither do, nor ſuffer any thing, but by Chriſt, by him he can want and abound, <hi>ye doe all things,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>through Chriſt, that ſtrengthens him.</hi> Any work is hard for a Chriſtian in his own ſtrength, a difficult work is nothing when the ſtrength of Chriſt comes in. O in his ſtrength, will a little <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> grapple with <hi>Goliah</hi> and foil him too.</p>
               <p>But as he is ſtrength to the Saints, ſo is he all indeed to them, yea all they ſtand in need
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:171624:74"/>of him to be; he is a righteouſneſſe to cover them, and an interceder to the Father for them, yea what ſhal I ſay more, he is an everli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving faithful high Prieſt, yea our King and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, our ark where we may ſafely ride when a world lies round, deſtroyed, O Chriſt, O Chriſt, what ſhall I ſay of thee? our ark, our pillar, our cloude by day, our pillar by night, our rock and ſhadow in a weary land, our life, our all in all, and at all times.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, it ſhowes us our advantage by Chriſt, <hi>we are juſtified by his blood, wee are ſanctified by his ſpirit, and ſaved by his merit.</hi> O the blood of Chriſt cleanſeth us from all ſin, <hi>which the blood of buls and goats could never doe,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeakes.</p>
               <p>Does Satan lay ſin to your charge, tell him thou art juſtified by Chriſt? doth he lay great ſins to thee, tell him, Chriſt juſtifieth from all ſins, of all kinds, great and ſmall; yea, tell him, thou art no ſinner at all, neither doth the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther look upon thee as one in his Sons righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe. Truely when a poor ſoule is carried by his power, thus to argue with Satan, we winde him as a man doth a childe: but elſe he binds, and locks us up in bondage, fears, and darkneſſe, that our very ſoules are reſtleſſe day and night, being filled with doubts, and his accuſements, he is therefore called <hi>the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:171624:74"/>of the brethren,</hi> he accuſeth God to man, and man to God, envying both.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, our glory with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And firſt, the certainty of it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the greatneſſe.</p>
               <p>O ſaith the Spirit, thy glory is ſure, its laid, and kept too for thy comming: but as it is ſure and ſafe laid up by Chriſt, ſo it is full and large, and therefore called by <hi>Paul, a weight of glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here we many times admire the light pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſhadowes of glory, and forget the true ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance God hath laid up for us in his Son, and heavens, <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, nor eare heard, neither ever entred into the heart of man, to conceive,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, what God hath laid up for us.</hi> Eye hath not ſeen ſure, the eye hath ſeen <hi>Solomons</hi> glory; yea, all the gloryes of this world too. O ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> that is nothing, theſe things are nothing, but painted ſhadowes and butterflies, after which the fooles of this world runs, like little children: and for the eare too, what hath that heard; ſurely of all that hath been true, and as much more too, by reports of fained gods, and glories in the <hi>Poets</hi> lying ſtories: but were all theſe things true, yet God hath laid up more glorie for the pooreſt Saints that walks in rags, then all that they have wrought, thou heard, or thought; no, thou canſt not think, ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> nor no man living,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:171624:75"/>
                  <hi>what God hath laid up for them that fear him.</hi> Surely, men might fancie more then hath been ſeen or heard.</p>
               <p>Well, ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> fancy all that this world hath ſeen, or heard; yea, fancie another world too, with as many joyes and pleaſures of this world, as griefs and ſorrows, yet all ſhort, and nothing.</p>
               <p>O Chriſtian, little doeſt thou think, and leſſe the world, what God hath laid up in ſtore for thee, and all his ſervants.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, a river is advantagious, and uſefull; ſo is the Spirit, <hi>it helps our infirmities, wee know not what to pray for, as we ought: but the Spirit helpeth us, with groanes which cannot be uttered.</hi> O the Spirits groanings in us, are powerfull prayers before God for us, the promiſes are made to the Spirit praying in us, and indeed thoſe requeſts we are denyed of God, are not from the Spirit, but from fleſh and blood; and therefore it is that they are loſt for the moſt part: but the Spirit who knowes the minde of God, never drawes forth a Chriſtian to aske any thing, but what is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the minde of God, and this he cannot but grant.</p>
               <p>But thou complaineſt, thou art an ignorant ſoule, true; <hi>the naturall man knows nothing, but the ſpirituall new man in the naturall man
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:171624:75"/>knows all things; yea, the deep things of God,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>a naturall man is ſaid to be a dead man every where in Scripture, and the dead, ſaith Solomon, knowes nothing, hee knowes not he lyes in the grave of ſinne and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, mouldering as it were into duſt:</hi> call him to come forth from wormes and putrifa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, yet he ſtirres not at all: even ſo the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall man, tell him his condition, he believes it not, call him to come forth of the grave of nature, ſinne and death, he ſtirres not, nor indeed cannot, he is bound up ſo by the power of the Devil, ſinne and darkneſſe.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, a river runnes ſilently, and makes little or no noiſe at all, have you never found the Spirit running in a Sermon, at a praier, in a conference, but eſpecially in a meditation with little noiſe, it ſweetly turning thy ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry blood in thy veins, making thy heart, as it were to wamble: I know you have many times. Truly, when this river runnes trickling up and down the Soul, making little noiſe in the Soul, yea, dipping, and diving of her in Divine delights, which many talking Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are ignorant of.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, a river is deep, ſo is the Spirit in its diſcoveries. He diſcovers the deep things of God, and Chriſt, and the Goſpel, which others cannot reach nor fathom by wit nor
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:171624:76"/>Learning, no, it is out of their element, I have heard as wiſe able men, at leaſt ſo count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and are ſo ſure in civill things, in lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Law, or Fathers, ſpeaking of this river, and the nature of it, but as much out of the way, as any blind man ever was without his guide. The maskd man turns and winds, but ſtill beſide the way: the Sinner does the like, following carnall reaſon, to find out Chriſt and his river, and therefore, friend ſit down, it is midnight yet in thy ſoul: if the day break, and Chriſt the ſtarre ariſe in thee, thou ſhalt ſee this river, yea the depth of it in ſome meaſure, a depth beyond all depths, thou ever metſt withall. Here, one depth calls to another, like the eccho to the voice. Gods decrees and purpoſes anſwered by his Sonne. Theſe depths are clearly ſeen by look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into this river, and if thy ſight be ſtrong indeed, then thou ſhalt ſee the ſonnes of men, like precious ſtones, and pebbles lying in the bottome, from thence plummed up by Chriſt to ſwim a top, as in a ſea of pleaſure.</p>
               <p>Eightly, a river is cool, and bathing, we go to rivers in Summer heats to cool and bath our bodies. O come hither and bath your Souls, your heated Souls, heated with ſinne, heated with guilt, heated with apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons too of wrath, heated with Satan and
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:171624:76"/>temptations: truly, many a poore ſoul is heated by ſinne, and then chaſed by Satan for his ſin, ſo heard, that his ſoul even fainteh: well friend, my advice is, come unto this river, for here thou mayeſt cool and bath thee.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, a river is alwayes moving, and working, ſo is the Spirit, it is active in the ſouls of Gods people, though ſometimes not deſcerned. <hi>I ſleep, but my heart awaketh, ſaith the Spouſe</hi> in the <hi>Canticles.</hi> Thou art dead, and dull in praier many times, but the Spirit being wakefull, ſees thee, and after chides thee for it, ſometimes thou art nodding in the creature, but the Spirit wakes and jogges thee by ſecret calling on thee, which if thou refuſeſt to heare, then he ſayes little for the preſent, but ſends ſome afflictions to thee, and if that do not do, then he ſends a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and another, every one ſharper then the former, and ſo makes thee heare to the purpoſe, agine in the tenth place.</p>
               <p>A river is reflective, ye may ſee your ſelfe, or ſhadowes in a river: and by the Spirit, you may ſee your ſelf, your face, your ſouls, your hearts, your natures, and affections: the heart ſaith <hi>Salomon</hi> who knows it truly, none but the Spirit, and the Spirit dwelling in it therefore by the by.</p>
               <p>Thou that ſayeſt, and complaineſt of a hard
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:171624:77"/>and ſinfull heart, ſure, it is the Spirit in thy heart, that gives thee thus to ſee it, and all its windings from God, which are more then the doores of <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it ſhows you your nature and corruptions which have more ſinne in it, then there is poiſon in the world: ſinne in nature, is like an old running ſore which cannot be ſtopped, or if it be, it breaks out again: ſo ſinne in nature ſtops pride, and out comes covetouſneſſe: ſtop that, and out comes pride, and prodigalitie, ſtop up that, and then back againe to old unwearied father <hi>worldling,</hi> drunkenneſſe ſtopt, does the like, luſt runs as long as it can in old filthy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicators, but when it is ſpent, they turne to baudy talkers. I have ſeen old carnall fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows laugh and wiker at their youthfull pranks in the feaſts and Iunkets, yea, ſuch as have had one foot in the grave; poore miſerable men did they know their own condition, the reckoning they muſt give for every idle word, and every ſinfull action, which Chriſt ſpeaks in <hi>Matthew,</hi> one thought, one ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thought of that would ſtrike us dead as <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> that great King was at the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing, in the midſt of his feaſt with his Nobles, <hi>dinking healths in bowls of Gold his countenance fell, his joynts looſened, and his
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:171624:77"/>knees knockd one againſt another,</hi> no more, but remember this filthy ſinner.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it ſhowes your affections, and which way they ſtream and run, a man by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can never ſee how wide they run from God and Chriſt, ſometimes biaſſe, drawn by a wife, a child, a husband, ſometimes by the world, and the worlds pleaſures, profits, which like two ſtrumpets entiſes all, not kept by Chriſt, and as dangerouſly takes them as that ſtrumpet, <hi>Salomon</hi> acquaints the young man with, <hi>and how her paths go down to hell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, by the Spirit you may ſee your name in the Lambes book, your wedding robe, and Supper, with your reſt and glory in the Throne of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>O thou fooliſh man, that ſpendeſt thy dayes in gazing up and down the world, let me exhort thee to come hither, for heres an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject worth the ſeeing, and thou O Chriſtian friend, let me intreat thee alſo to looke into this river, this clear and Chriſtall river: but ſtay a little, me thinks I heare one ſay, what is it to look into this river? Firſt, it is not to look into your own light, for that is blind, and hath no reflection at all. Secondly, it is not to look with anothers light, for that is, as if you would look by anothers eyes: but to be ſhort, if you would ſee this pure living ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:171624:78"/>Firſt come in Gods light to ſee, and then ye ſhall ſee; is it not a thouſand better lights that will ſhow you the greateſt light, a thouſand candles cannot ſhow the ſunne; nay a thouſand torches, nor a thouſand ſtarres can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not; you muſt ſee him by his owne light, or not at all: but firſt look into this river by the light of God, and then it will be a river of pleaſure indeed unto thy ſoul, all its ſtreames will be pleaſurable and glad thy very heart. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 46.4. there is a river, <hi>the ſtreames thereof ſhall make glad the City of our God.</hi> Yea all its turnings will delight thy ſoul.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Looke in this river by the light of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> he is the true light that enlightens every man that comes into the world, and therefore called, <hi>the light of lights, Iohn</hi> 8.12. I, that is the right way indeed, if ye mean to ſee; if men will neglect God and <hi>Chriſts</hi> light, then let me tell them, they ſhall never ſee, they ſhall never finde this well of life, this river of life, let them look their eyes out, let them look their lives out, wiſe men have try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, wiſe men ſtrived, but Oh, alaſſe, in vaine, for they could never find it, but rather more were blinded.</p>
               <p>The Father ſhewes us the Sonne, and the Sonne ſhewes us the Father; <hi>No man knowes
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:171624:78"/>the Father but the Sonne, and he to whom the Sonne reveales him; no man knowes the Sonne but the Father, and he to whom the Father doth the like.</hi> So likewiſe the Spirit ſhewes the Sonne, <hi>Behold the Lambe of God,</hi> ſo ſaith the Sonne; <hi>Behold the River of God,</hi> as in this text; and all the world cannot ſhew us the Father but the Sonne; nor all the world cannot ſhew us the Sonne but the Father: <hi>Behold this day,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>have I begotten him;</hi> nor all the world cannot ſhew us the Spirit, nor the River of life, the Well of life, nor the Fountaine of life but the Sonne; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith <hi>Chriſt, Buy of me eye ſalve that yee may ſee, Rev.</hi> 3. <hi>laſt v.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How blind was <hi>Bartholmew</hi> till <hi>Chriſt</hi> came and opened his eyes; juſt ſo was thy ſoule, and is thy ſoule without <hi>Chriſt? I am the light of the world,</hi> ſaith <hi>Chriſt, he that walks in mee ſhall not abide in darkneſſe, but ſhall have the light of lights,</hi> John 6.</p>
               <p>So ſaith <hi>Paul, God that cauſed light to ſhine out of darkneſſe, hath given us the knowledge of himſelfe in the face of Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> marke that; and indeed <hi>Iohn</hi> had all his viſions by <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> the golden candleſticks, new <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> the Glory of God, the Throne of God, the Garment, the wedding Supper, and all thoſe heavenly things; and therefore get
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:171624:79"/>thee gone fooliſh man, that ſtands dreaming to ſee this river in thy own light.</p>
               <p>Get me gone, O but whither ſhall I goe? whither; why, where thou ſhouldſt goe, and all others, that have any minde to ſee this pure, pleaſant, living river.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſtion.</hi> O but what ſhall I ſay to <hi>Chriſt</hi> when I come to him: What ſhalt thou ſay?</p>
               <p>Firſt, Tell him thou art a poore blind ſoule, and wert born ſo; and that thou canſt not ſee thy right hand from thy left; and withall, as to tell him how blind thou art; ſo be ſure to bewaile thy ſelfe, and ſay, O <hi>Chriſt,</hi> I would ſee the river of life, the well of life; why doſt not thou O man? why doe not I, O <hi>Chriſt,</hi> I am blinde thou knoweſt, I am blind and cannot ſee; why how came it, or what aileſt thou? O Chriſt I was borne blind of my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; yea, ring your hands, weep, waile and cry, O unhappy man, O unhappy wretch, O unhappy ſoule, O that I ſhould be born blind, and have no eyes to ſee the Glory of God, the Throne of God, the River of God, and ſay as I bid thee; O Chriſt I came blind into the world, ſhall I die ſo too, farre be it from thee, O thou God of mercy; and be ſure to, as I ſaid, to bewaile thy ſelfe, and then I will pawn my life for it, Chriſt will come by, and
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:171624:79"/>ſay, what aileſt thou man; and now Chriſt is of a good nature, very pitifull, eſpecially to poor ſoules, bemoaning and lamenting themſelves for want of life, legs, or limbes, or light, or ſight, or eyes, or any ſuch like things, for Chriſt knowes how uſefull ſuch things are for poore creatures, and how they are like to dead men in graves without them; or juſt walking like ghoſts in the ſhapes of men, which is as meere a deluſion as can be in the world; but as I was about to tell thee, be ſure when Chriſt comes by and asketh thee why thou mourneſt, weepſt and wringſt thy hands; then ſay, O Lord Jeſus I am blind, I am blind, O that I might receive my ſight, ſweet Jeſus looke upon me, <hi>O thou Sonne of David have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy upon me;</hi> and if any ſhould reprove thee for troubling Chriſt, be ſure you be not daunted or beaten off for crying after him, but cry louder, yea, as loud as you are able, and ſay, Lord Jeſus if thou paſſeſt by and will not helpe, I will tell thy Father of thee, who ſent thee purpoſely to helpe ſuch poor wretches as I am; and then Chriſt will ſay to them that bid him let thee alone, <hi>I</hi> muſt goe doe my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers work leaſt he chide me.</p>
               <p>And then they will ſay, doe it to morrow, O but ſaith Chriſt, <hi>I muſt do my worke while it is day, the night comes, when no man can
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:171624:80"/>worke. John.</hi> 9. <hi>v.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>And then Chriſt will come and ſay, why did you cry ſo after me, <hi>O thou Son of David? that I may receive my ſight,</hi> and this will pleaſe Chriſt very well.</p>
               <p>And thus you ſee what you get by my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell in bemoaning your blind ſoule, and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after Chriſt, you are now made whole, and ſee as well as any, I dare ſay, thou wouldeſt not be in ſuch a condition for a thouſand pound; no truely, not for a thouſand worlds neither; for what would all the world have done me good, if I had lived blind and darkly all my dayes, I muſt needs have been ignorant of God and Chriſt, and the river of life, when as now, I thank God, I ſee all theſe things, and I tell you, thouſands of wiſe men do not, but are juſt of my condition as can be; but ſure they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched, I think, for they do not know their own condition, if they did, they would cry as I did.</p>
               <p>O but from my ſoul, I thanke, and I thanke you Sir, my good friend, for directing mee to Chriſt, O ſir, if you had not, I had been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done for ever and ever: for I muſt needs have beene damnd; for I muſt have died in my ſins, which I did not think of; alaſſe, <hi>I</hi> was a man that minded nothing, the Lord knowes, till you fell a talking of <hi>the river of life,</hi> and ſpeaking
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:171624:80"/>many things about this river.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> came to aske you, how <hi>I</hi> might doe to ſee it; for <hi>I</hi> remember, you were ſpeaking, how clear, how pure, how beautifull it was; and like wiſe, how ſweet, and uſefull, advantagious, and deſireable it was, and a long diſcourſe you know to that purpoſe, ſo then <hi>I</hi> think, <hi>I</hi> askt you, how <hi>I</hi> might do to ſee this pure, living, cleare, and chryſtall river, and you told mee, to my thinking, a ſtrange thing at the firſt. For you told me, <hi>I</hi> muſt not ſee it in mine own light which made me ſtare and wonder at you; good Lord, thought <hi>I,</hi> what does the man mean, would he lend mee his eyes, thought <hi>I;</hi> nay, you told me further, <hi>I</hi> muſt not goe in the light of another man, God bleſſe me, thought <hi>I,</hi> the man is mad as ſure as can be, <hi>I</hi> muſt not ſee in mine own light, nor anothers, but then he told me, as <hi>I</hi> remember, how pure, how pleaſant this river was. O ſaid he, it is a pure, living river, and an ever living river, an everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting river, and a great deale of diſcourſe about this river, ſo that <hi>I</hi> thought indeed he would never have done with this river.</p>
               <p>But to be ſhort, in my relation about this ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; <hi>I</hi> think, <hi>I</hi> ſaid, ſhow me this river; but ſaith he, you cannot ſee it in your own light, O thought <hi>I</hi> in my ſelfe, he counts me one of the blind men of the world, becauſe <hi>I</hi> did never
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:171624:81"/>much away with the new lights of our world, which was never halfe ſo many, <hi>I</hi> think, as now, ſince the world ſtood.</p>
               <p>But to come to my ſtory, he told mee as I could not ſee that Chryſtall river by my own eyes, ſo no more could I ſee it by another mans, ſo I plainly ſaw, he did not at all weigh the miniſters, <hi>I</hi> mean the old Orthodox Divines, <hi>I</hi> think theſe new fellows he did well approve of, and ſeeme to own, ſaying, they were clear Goſpell-preachers, and did hold forth Chriſt very well: diſtingniſhing the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Covenants.</p>
               <p>But then in relation to the river, he told me, if <hi>I</hi> would ſee it, <hi>I</hi> muſt, ſaid he, ſee it in Gods own light; and ſo quoted <hi>David</hi> ſaying, <hi>in thy light we ſhall ſee light,</hi> and then he told me, <hi>I</hi> muſt ſee this river in Chriſts light too, ſaying thus, as God was Chriſts light, ſo Chriſt was Gods light, ſaid he to me, <hi>no man can ſee the Father, but by the Son, and he to whom the Son doth reveal him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then he told me further, that the father reveals the ſonne, and the ſonne the father, and both the ſpirit and the river, by giving of it to the ſonnes of men, and ſo indeed he lead me up and down in a miſ-maze, for I had never in all my life before heard ſo much talk of revealing, and I know not what, of the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:171624:81"/>father, ſonne, and ſpirit, and the river, for ſo he called the ſpirit, ſaying, it was a pure, clear, and living river, ſtill talking of I know not how many lights, and I never knew but of one here, which rules the day. So thought I, what doth this man mean by his lights, but he turned I know not how, about to a light of God, and a light and life of Chriſt, or in Chriſt, I think he called it, ſaying, it was the ſureſt and ſafeſt, and the ſweeteſt, the happieſt, beſt, and bleſſedeſt life of all lives that the ſoul lived, when it lived in God, the fountaine of light and life, endleſſe light, and endleſſe life.</p>
               <p>For indeed, God is the life of our lives, the root of our lives, the fountain of our lives, we live in our own element, ſaid he, when we live in God, and when we live out of him: we pilgrime like, wander up and down the world, begging preſervation of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very poore creature, which is a ſad condition for a noble ſoul, yea we bury our ſelves as in a grave of darkneſſe, which few loves, being nothing, but wandering and rottenneſſe, earth turning into earth: but in one word, I wind up all, the river is the Spirit, the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſpirit of God by which he doth all in the world, yea all his mighty works, he binds Kings and looſes Captives, breaketh nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and binds them up again, and as Kings
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:171624:82"/>and Nations, private men and perſons, are bound and looſed, comforted and wounded, and all by this Spirit, Oh then doth it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern all, high, low, rich and poore, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace this ſpirit; for if ye ſlight him, he can <hi>ſmite you, wound you, kill you,</hi> and damne ſoul and body, O then come and kiſſe this enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Sonne, as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks of Chriſt in his ſecond <hi>Pſalm, leſt that he be angry,</hi> its ſaid of this Sun that rules the day, that it ſhall one day break forth in ſuch flames of heat &amp; bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that it ſhall ſcorch and burn up Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, the ſpirit will do the ſame, yea, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man and woman, in one way or other, ſome in love, moſt in dreadfull wrath and vengeance, for neglecting and abuſing the love, grace and mercy, which he once freely tendred them, which they little minded, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like the old world, buying, felling, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying: all the time of <hi>Noahs</hi> arkes build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yea, untill the very flood came; but then how did they run and tumble, O me thinks I ſee the whole world ſhifting, ſome to the hills, others to the mountains, ſome climb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing trees and cedars, and getting up to ſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, whilſt others wade to <hi>Noah:</hi> yea beg, and hang upon his Ark, crying <hi>Noah, Noah, Noah,</hi> for pitie take us in, but he is ſecure, and minds not all their skreeks and cryes, nor
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:171624:82"/>their dolefull mourning for their drowned ſouls, this he little minds, for he is ſafe, and his Ark ariſes by the mighty waters, in the which he rides more and more ſteady, the higher that they riſe, carying him at laſt over hils and mountaines and all kindes of dangers.</p>
               <p>And now he ſings this unto himſelfe, God hath ſafely houſed me, God hath ſafely kept me in a ſhelter from the raines, which the black and melancholy heavens have weeped day and night for the ſinnes of men, till they were drowned with teares; well, <hi>Noah</hi> is yet ſafe, the hangers on the Ark waſht off, ſcreeks and cries over, all ſwimme up and down the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge. Well, the mighty waters doe beginne to beat, and the heavens ſmile by clearing up againe; <hi>Noah</hi> ſends out his Dove, ſhee ſoone returnes, he againe doth the like, ſhe brings in an Olive branch, an Emblem of peace to all in the Ark. Well, this Ark is Chriſt, and none there is but he, that can ſafely ſhelter from all kinde of danger, and yet this Ark is open, and ready to receive all that will come in at the Spirits invitation; but what if they doe not? the Spirit will break forth in dreadfull flames of fire, drying up the Seas, and burning of the Mountaines, none, no not one eſcaping but thoſe in the Ark. Well friend minde this, Chriſt is the Ark, the Spirit is the River, God
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:171624:83"/>the Fountaine too, of light, life, and glory; ſhall all be neglected, then thou art undone; O unhuppy ſoul, ill betide the time, and curſed be the day that ever thou waſt born.</p>

               <p>And firſt, theſe words they are a Promiſe of God to his people, who are the perſons to whom this Promiſe is made.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Promiſe it ſelfe, which is, <hi>They ſhall ſee my face;</hi> that is the thing, O chriſtian, promiſed heare.</p>

               <p>Chriſtians you know this, I know yee know it in ſome meaſure; but what is the reaſon you

And how, doth another complaine for loſſe of tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; O my poverty comes on me like an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med man, miſtake me not, I know chriſtians have bowels of compaſſion more then any, and may moderately complaine for friends and want; but ſhould they, ſhould they greive, as men unhappy, without hope of ever enjoying of that they they have loſt? No, no, they ſhould not; my Husband is dead, but my Chriſt is alive, and lives for ever; my Wife is dead, yet am I the Spouſe of Chriſt, and becauſe he lives, I ſhall live, <hi>John</hi> 17. I have loſt my Childe, but yet am I the Child of God, the Son of God, Heires, joynt-Heires with Chriſt; my eſtate is ſpent, and becauſe of that the world will not ſmile, friends look ſtrange becauſe of poverty I was wont, but now ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not ſee their faces in my diſtreſſe; well, what of that, art thou troubled at this?

               <p> O Lord how wonderfull is that, <hi>Heaven and earth is full of thy Glory, Pſal.</hi> 8.9. all the glories of this world are but ſhadowes of thy glory; yea, all the glory of Heaven, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and arch-Angels, Cherubims and Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phims are but the reflecting ſhadowes of thy glory, thy uncreated glory, thy increated glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: O my God, when <hi>Moſes</hi> begged to ſee this, thou wouldſt not; alas, poore ſoule, he could not, <hi>No man can ſee my glory and live,</hi> but time is a comming when they ſhall ſee my glory, my naked glory, and live; yea, live by ſeeing, and ſee by living, by living in it, by li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to it, in ſinging praiſes alwayes before it; and then, O happy Chriſtian: ſhalt thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get all former things, all former ſorrows, all former feares, all former griefs.</p>
               <p>O how then will theſe things paſſe away and be forgot, as if they had never been.</p>
               <p>I remember, <hi>Peter</hi> having but a glimpſe of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> glory in the mount, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red then to live, and to die in that mount; but thou, O precious Chriſtian, ſhalt live and never dye in this mount, mount <hi>Sion,</hi> hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where thou ſhalt ſee <hi>Moſes,</hi> yea, a thouſand <hi>Moſes,</hi> and ten thouſand times ten thouſand glorious Saints, as well as he, with as many Angels with God and Chriſt, excelling all ten thouſand times over, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

O but when will that day come, that I a poore Gentile ſinner ſhall ſee this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Heavens, Saints, and Angels excelling glory: will it come? doe thou ſay it will come, and it will make amends for all, it is now a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming; <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>We ſee now but darkly, as in a glaſſe,</hi> we ſhall ſee him then naked as he is.</p>
               <p>Chriſt tels thee friend, in <hi>John</hi> 17: 22. <hi>And the glory that thou haſt given me, I have given them, that they may be one, O Father, as we are one.</hi> Here thou ſeeſt, that Chriſt prayes for this day, and yet thou as keſt, ſhall this day ever come?</p>
               <p>O friend, know this, that what ever Chriſt prayes for, he wils, and what he wils ſhall come to paſſe; as in <hi>John</hi> 17.24. <hi>Father I will that all theſe thou haſt given me, may be with me, even where I am, to behold my glory.</hi> Chriſts glory is Gods glory, and Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is Chriſts glory; and this wils Chriſt that yee may ſee.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Thrice happy, yea, ten thouſand times thrice happy are they, O Chriſt, whom thou wilt ſhalt ſee thy glory in thy Kingdome, in thy Throne. O my Chriſt, it is ſaid, that the

                  <hi>Kings and the Captaines too, ſhall hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their dens, and among the rocks, and mountaines, crying to the rocks, and calling to the mountaines to fall on them, from thy glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and thy preſence. Revel.</hi> 6.15.</p>
               <p>And this I will, ſaith Chriſt, to confound mine enemies, which will not that I ſhould reign over them, or in them; had they hearkened to mee, or accepted of mee, my righteouſneſſe when time was, they ſhould not have need to be aſhamed of their nakedneſſe, or call and cry to the hils to cover their poor ſoules: but this is juſt, ſeeing, they did when time was, reject me, this in one day ſhall come on them: but when theſe things ſhall come on them like tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels on a woman, ye ſhall lift up your heads with boldneſſe, becauſe my glory and yours too, drawes neer.</p>
               <p>O frinds, no marveile, that wicked men ſhall runne to the caves and dens, and rocks, to hide themſelves in: for the Saints ſhall in that day ſhine as ſo many ſunnes, and Chriſt as a ſunne to all.</p>
               <p>O glorious day, O day of dayes, that is now a comming, this is that day, <hi>that the righteous ſhall ſhine in the kingdome of their Father. Matth.</hi> 13.43. Then when they ſee the face of God and Chriſt, and this is nothing but the reflects of Gods glory, beaming out on the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:171624:86"/>Saints, in the beholding of his face, but yet this glory is not all that is implied, when God ſaith, <hi>Ye ſhall ſee my face,</hi> For it implies as well as his glory, his love, and delight, which you know are moſt apparant in the face; for you judge of mens love and affections, by the face and countenance: ſo that, to ſee this face, is to ſee his love, and delight in you, and on you, Delight ariſeth out of love, and flowes from love, as affections from relations.</p>
               <p>But of this love and delight, what ſhall I ſay, and firſt for this love, this pure love, flowing from the fountaine of love, yea, divien love. Secondly, it is ſweet love, yea, ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the honey, or the honey-combe. Thirdly, it is ſtrong love, and long love, firſt, it is ſtrong love, for it ſo bindes the Saint, yea, ſo ſtrongly binds him by its diſcoveries to him, that as with coards his ſoul is drawn to love, and bound, and cannot but love; yea, love ſtill more and more, this is that love, that is ſtronger then death; yea, then death that kills all things: but cannot this love, nor ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhall; <hi>O death I will be thy death,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, ſo ſaith love, I am, and ſtill will be: but thou, like fading time, ſhall be no more, <hi>The Angel ſwore, that time ſhould be no more. Revel.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>But for love, Chriſt wills, <hi>that it ſhall be for
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:171624:86"/>ever, Iohn</hi> 17. <hi>v.</hi> 23. let the world know, ſaith Chriſt to the Father, <hi>that thou haſt loved them, as thou lovedſt me.</hi> O when God ſhall ceaſe to love his Chriſt, then Chriſt ſhall ceaſe to love his Saints.</p>
               <p>O friend, God cannot but love his Son, nor he, but love his Father, nor both, but love the Saints; and they that be wrapt thus up in love, muſt needs, and cannot, but love againe, and thus this love binds up in one a Saint in Chriſt, a Chriſt in God; and thus a Saint, a Chriſt, and God is one, as Chriſt ſaith. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 17.21.23. <hi>Father, I will that they in me, and I in thee may be one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O glorious union, A Saint in Chriſt, a Chriſt in God, here is Unitie in Trinity, and Trinitie in Unitie. O earth, earth; how art thou joynd to heaven, and by hearing the word of God, I mean his Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And now <hi>Adam, Adam,</hi> made of duſt, where art thou now man, in the garden of God, or in God himſelf? O happy change, O happy man, O happy fall, from God to Eden, and then to earth, and thence raiſed up to God againe.</p>

It was nothing but ſinne that made a ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe between God, and man; for before man had ſinned, there was no ſtrangeneſſe between God and man, but ſince ſinne came, there hath been a ſtrangeneſſe all along, but before there was none: for when God made man firſt, he was not at all afraid of God; for God before ſinne came, took our father <hi>Adam,</hi> and led him by the hand, as it were, and put him into the garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> as a father would his ſon into a vineyard <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.15. So God led, or put <hi>Adam</hi> into the garden of <hi>Eden, and bids
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:171624:88"/>him eat of all the fruit of the garden, onely the tree of good and evill excepted,</hi> and then <hi>Adam</hi> goes to naming of the creatures of God. <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.20.</p>
               <p>O here was no feare at all in <hi>Adam</hi> yet, for he goes and ſets names on all the creatures, which God had made, juſt like a child naming his fathers works; but aſſoon as <hi>Adam</hi> had ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, he is filled with fear, and timerouſneſſe, and hearing then the voice of God in the gat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, he runnes and hides himſelfe from God, and is afraid of God; witneſſe his running from God, to hide himſelf from God. Juſt ſo have all the ſons of <hi>Adam</hi> done all along, to this day, ſo that though God would be fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar with them, yet they cannot be ſo with him, there is ſinne got into the fleſh, and to that, <hi>God is a conſuming fire of holineſſe,</hi> ſo that now, God muſt ſpeak in a ſecondary way, by an Angel, or by a meſſenger, and that too they are afraid of, as the ſhepherds were of the Angel, that bids them, feare not, ſaying, <hi>I am come to bring glad tidings of great joy to all nations; for unto you a Saviour is this day born, and ye ſhall call his name</hi> Jeſus, <hi>for hee ſhall ſave his people from their ſinnes. Luke</hi> 2.9, 10.</p>
               <p>And now, God being clothed in fleſh, man he drawes neer to God, which before cryed
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:171624:89"/>out in every diſcovery, like <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 6.5. <hi>I am undone, I have ſeen the Lord:</hi> but God being not willing, that man ſhould be ſtrange to him, or he to man, ſends his owne Sonne un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, to tell us, he is not at all angry with us, nor will at once harme us, but rather faine would have us to be as at firſt, his familial creatures; yea, more, to be his ſons and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and to come live againe in his paradice; nay, more, to live in himſelfe, and with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: and this is clear, by his comming down to live with us; nay, in us by his Son. And this is the way, by which God will again diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover himſelfe, and ſhow his face, his pleaſant face, in a fatherly way unto us.</p>
               <p>O great and wonderfull, O myſterie of my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, who would have thought of ſuch a way as this, to have found a bleſſed God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. O <hi>Adam!</hi> loſt! couldſt thou have thought of this way? O angels, all ye angels, could ye have thought of this way? no, no, I dare ſay no, nor all the world beſides you; it is ſaid by <hi>Paul, when Angels heard of this myſterie, Gods coming down into fleſh, to find and bring back man, loſt man again, it was ſuch a myſterie to the Angels, that they deſired to peep into it, Oh how farre was</hi> Ioſeph <hi>carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from good old</hi> Iacob, <hi>but yet at laſt he ſaw his face again.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:171624:89"/>
               <p> So farre and further, yea ten thouſand times, furthermore were ye ſold by <hi>Eve,</hi> and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by Satan; but God like <hi>Jacob</hi> comes down, though not for want, yet for his love, <hi>to bring ye back to your own place,</hi> it is ſaid, when the Iſraelites were delivered out of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, they were as men in a dream,</hi> they had been ſo long in Captivity, and were <hi>ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly delivered unepxected, Pſalme</hi> 137. But loſt man, thou leſſe expectedſt, if leſſe could be, thy great deliverance, that God by Chriſt, ſhould bring back thee from <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> a ſtrange land to Chriſt in <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> where plenty, and all fullneſſe dwels, <hi>and now will God again become your God, and dwell with you,</hi> now it may be truly ſaid, <hi>the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they ſhall be his people, and God himſelf will be there God with them,</hi> Rev. 21.3. Mark this, God himſelf will be with them; this being with them, denotes Gods familiarity to them: where ſtrangeneſſe is, there can be no familiarity, but ſtrangeneſſe now ſhall be no more; for God will dwell with them, and they with him. O they muſt needs ſee his face, who dwell in his preſence, <hi>In thy preſence O God, is fulneſſe of joy, and pleaſures for evermore,</hi> ſo ſaith <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.8.</p>
               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:171624:90"/>
               <p> Here is a fullneſſe indeed, Firſt, a feeding fullneſſe, Secondly, a filling fullneſſe, Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, an overflowing fullneſſ. Firſt, a feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fullneſse, O Chriſtian, it ſhall feed thy very ſoul, to ſee the face of God and Chriſt, Secondly, a filling fullneſs, it ſhall fill thy heart, yea every corner of thy heart and ſoul too: it ſhall ſo fill thee, that thou ſhalt be, as David ſaid in his Pſalm. <hi>filled with mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and fatneſſe.</hi> Thirdly, an overflowing fullneſs, for thou ſhalt be ſo filled with the ſight of thy God, that thou ſhalt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow with delight.</p>
               <p>Here the diſcoveries of God, have an emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs in the ſoul, that there is ſtill an emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs in thee, but in that day, thou ſhalt be as a veſsell brim-full, and not ſo, but overflow with the fullneſs of Gods diſcoveries to thy ſoul, he ſhall ſo immediately diſcover him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to thee. Here Gods diſcoveries, are in a ſecondary way, but then thou ſhalt have them immediately from himſelf, and not by any hand conveyed, but by himſelf; his preſence with thee, ſhall be a flowing fatneſs: yea an overflowing fullneſs in thee: and in that day, thou ſhalt know the relations thy ſoul ſtands in to God, thou ſhalt know him to be a father indeed, he ſhall ſo fatherly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover himſelf to thee. Here God carries him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:171624:90"/>ſometimes to his children, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> did to his brethren, rough and ſtrange; but then God ſhall ſay to his children, O my deare children, how do I love you, yea, I love you more and more, I loved you before, and now I cannot hide my bowels from you; yea, I cannot but ſhow my love to you, come my deare children for whom I prepared Glory before the world was, as Chriſt ſpeaks, <hi>John;</hi> come, ſit down by me, I will tell you over my love, I loved you before I had you, but now I have you, I cannot but embrace you, ye were my delight long before the world was, I rowled you in my thoughts, I had you in my eye, and carried you in my purpoſe, and bought you by my Chriſt, O my deare children, <hi>let me wipe away all teares from your eyes,</hi> Rev. 21.4.</p>
               <p>You were wont to mourn, but now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice and ſing, and let no man take your joy from you, as Chriſt ſpeaks, <hi>Iohn</hi> 16.20. <hi>you wont to grieve, but grief ſhall be no more, nor pain, nor ſorrow, nor any ſuch thing, ſhall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be again,</hi> I have you now, and I will no more nurſe you abroad, but ye ſhall live in my preſence, and becauſe I live, ye ſhall live alſo, as Chriſt ſpeaks in <hi>Iohn</hi> 16. O deare children, how did I long for this day, that I might have you in my preſence, and dandle you on my
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:171624:91"/>knee, &amp; ſpeak with you, and to you, the world was wont to ſnib you, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20.33. therefore I plagued it: the world abuſed you, and mifuſed you, but I ſaid, I would reckon with her for that: the world knew you not, &amp; therfore ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted you, but I knew you, and therefore loved you; yea, loved you more and more, I cannot but love, ye are my ſonnes and daughters, my Iewels, my preaſure, my treaſure, my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, my lot, my inheritance, and now what will you that I do for you, <hi>ſhow us thy face, and it ſufficeth us,</hi> John 14.8. O my ſons, and daughters, I will ſhow you my face, and glorie, my heart, and all the ſecrets of my ſoul, if that will ſatisfie you: O God, it is our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to ſee thy face, thy pleaſant face, thy glorie, thy tranſcendent glorie: but thy heart O God, what is that? my love, my intire love, my ſurpaſſingand indearing love; and for my thoughts, I mean my purpoſe, my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe towards you, which was of old, as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks of old; before time; yea, before time was at all; for before the world was no time, and then were you in my thoughts and purpoſe; I had a purpoſe of you, and on you: of you to make you my ſonnes and daughters, and a habitation for my glorie, that ye in ages to come might know, I loved you above all, and choſe you out of all
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:171624:91"/>the Nations of the world, that I might ſhow the exceeding riches of my grace to you, and for my purpoſe on you, it was to raiſe my glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry by you, in ſhewing it unto you, for if you had not ſeen my face, how could you know my glorie, but this I will that ye may know, how much I loved you, carrying you in my thoughts, time, &amp; time all along, yea, and long before time too, Chriſt and I was contracting your ſalvation, little did you once know my tranſactions, concerning your ſouls, but <hi>God was in Chriſt, reconciling the world to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> John 5.19. But now ye ſee my face, and my tranſactions too, all which you do admire; and more, and more you ſhall, to think how once I made you, and after that I loſt you, yet back again I bought you, and now to my ſelf have brought you, all this you muſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Ionas</hi> was in the deep, and his head wrapped with reeds and ruſhes, little did he think to have ever ſeen the ſhore again, leſſe, if leſs could be, did your ſouls think to have ſeen this day, which now you ſee; what I can do and bring about, that you might prize my face at laſt.</p>
               <p>But in the fourth place, whereas God doth promiſe, they ſhall ſee his face; It doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that great reward, by which he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:171624:92"/>his ſervants that ſerve him; ſo that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians doe not fight, as if there was no crown; nor worke, as if no wages. O ſaith <hi>Paul, I have fought the good fight, I have finiſhed the courſe, and henceforth is laid up for me a Crowne of life, and not for me onely, but for all that love his appearance too.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſtian, <hi>be thou faithfull unto the death, and thou ſhalt have the Crowne of life. Revel.</hi> 2.10. Where Chriſt promiſed it unto thee, for the incouraging of thee; Chriſtminded his owne glorie, and ſo maieſt thou as well as <hi>Moſes;</hi> ſee, Chriſt ſpeaks of it, yea, demands the Crown, <hi>John</hi> 16.1. <hi>I have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt me to do, and now glorifie thy ſonne,</hi> or reward thy ſon, and then it is ſaid, <hi>I have glorified thee, and I will glorifie thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O Friends, you are now glorified as you ſit, by your union with Chriſt, in the glorie of God, which ſhineth round the heavens, and makes them to be heavens indeed: wel friends, this is the glorie into which you muſt be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to behold his face, and then will not this be a reward, a full reward ineeed, tenne thouſand times beyond all your doings, and all your ſufferings: yea equall unto Chriſt his merits, and to thine hearts deſire; a Saints deſire is to ſee God, and enjoy God, nothing
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:171624:92"/>doth a Saint deſire in compariſon of that, <hi>with our ſouls have we deſired thee,</hi> ſaith the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> yea, and this is the deſire of every ſoul, everie gracious ſoul. O when the ſenſe of Gods eternall love, glorie, ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, lies boiling in it, how ſtrong doth the deſire riſe.</p>
               <p>O friends, no deſire under heaven, riſes and heaves ſo like to mighty waters in the Soul, as this deſire, when the ſenſe of Gods love and glorie lies boiling in it, and the mightie Spirit ſtirring of it, thunders do not more ſhake the cloudie aire, nor earthquakes move the dungie earth, then theſe deſires the ſoul of man, when it is ſtrongly rocking there. <hi>O</hi> ſaith <hi>Moſes, ſhew me thy face, or glorie,</hi> while his ſoul was filled with the ſenſe of it, he would fain ſee it, though he died the death for it, but God ſpares <hi>Moſes</hi> his life by hiding him and his glory for the preſent; well-know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Moſes</hi> was leſſe able for to ſee this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, which he requeſts he might, then we to ſee the Sunne through and through: but ſhall <hi>Moſes</hi> never ſee this glorie therefore, becauſe of weakneſſe; yes, yes, he ſhall, he doth, he now ſees it, and ſo ſhalt thou, O happy Chriſtian, ere it be long: what was it that took <hi>Peter,</hi> when he had a glimpſe of <hi>Moſes</hi> on the Mount, but the beames of this
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:171624:93"/>glory, ſparkling on his back, like glittering ſuns and ſtarres.</p>
               <p>Well friends, you wiſh and would, but time ſhall paſſe, and time ſhall come, and you enjoy the thing you wiſh &amp; crave, and often breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth after, namely, that glory that <hi>Moſes</hi> then appeared in, namely, on the mount; well, you ſhall, I ſay, you ſhall, as ſure as the Lord lives have it, one day have it, and be cloathed by it, as with a garment down to the ground, <hi>like the white robe, Rev.</hi> 19.14. and then like <hi>Moſes</hi> will your appearance be, as cloathed with twinkling ſtars from <hi>Phoebus</hi> beames.</p>
               <p>And now hearken, O heavens, and give ear O earth, earth, earth, with all that dwells therin, high, low, rich, poor, how God will glorifie his Son; and his Son, his Saints, to their hearts deſire, with men and Angels ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirations, and aſtoniſhments too. Well may <hi>David</hi> ſay, <hi>O Lord, I have none in heaven, but thee: and there is none in earth that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire in compariſon of thee;</hi> nay, Lord, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of thee, I ſcorn crowns, and kingdoms, yea, ten thouſand tuns of Jewels; marke, none in heaven, nor in earth, ſaith a <hi>David,</hi> in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of thee, and thus God rewards a Saint according to his hearts deſire: when he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth to ſhow his face unto them.</p>
               <p>O this reward will make amends for all, for
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:171624:93"/>all your ſufferings, for all your ſorrows; and now, in the hopes of this, raiſe your ſelves, your ſouls, in all your troubles, and caſtings down; and indeed nothing but this conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration will do it to any purpoſe, for if, by the loſſe of one creature you raiſe your ſelves by another; What will you then do, when all creature-comforts ſhall be taken away from you, which God, at firſt or laſt will ſurely doe.</p>
               <p>And then, what will ye then do; ye all of you, whoſe hearts are bound up in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and things of this life: But mourne, mourn bitterly, like <hi>Babylon, crying, alas, alas,</hi> Revel 18.10. <hi>How in one day have I loſt all my hopes,</hi> my creature comforts, my friends, my children, my wife and husband, my life and ſoul, and Chriſt more worth then all, ten thouſand times over and over againe.</p>
               <p>O unhappy man that I am, O unhappy ſoul, how waſt thou deluded, how was I deceived, to think my ſelf happy in a few dying crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-enjoyments, O my bewitched ſoul, who deluded thee, who deceived thee? time was thou heardſt of God and Chriſt; and hadſt thou then minded him, and ſerved him, as thou didſt thy King, thy luſt, and pleaſures, hee would not now have left thee, as dying <hi>Wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey</hi> once ſaid, that great <hi>Cardinall,</hi> in his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire and horror.</p>

               <p> But thou, O precious Chriſtian, whoſe heart and hopes are placed in God, ſhall dying ſay? my hopes, my heart, and expectation lives, for it was not here, nor here below, in dying things: but a living Chriſt, and now my ſoule ſhall live with him, <hi>and becauſe he lives, I ſhall live alſo. John</hi> 14.19. ye live in his preſence, &amp; live in his ſight; and now my ſoule, my happy ſoule, tell thou the world, thy friends, &amp; all that mournes for thy departure, thy life, thy life for which they mourne, its ſure and ſafe, its hid with God in Chriſt, our lives are hid with God in Chriſt, <hi>and when he ſhall appear, we ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear with him alſo,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks. <hi>John</hi> 1.3.2. O glorious day, O day of dayes, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought, unminded by moſt of men: now it appears not what we are, but then it ſhall, when the duſt of this body, more precious then the ſeed of ſtars and jewels ſhall be gathered, and be carefully picked up by Angels, ſent forth by Chriſt from all the winds for that ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, then my life was hid; but now it is found, where firſt it was in God and Chriſt, in my own root, and that to my dear ſouls content; and therefore let me go to my home, to my father, to my husband, to my God, to my Chriſt, and to my brethren; for ſure, I ſhall be welcome, as <hi>Jacob</hi> was to <hi>Joſeph.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Welcome for relations ſake, O friends, there
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:171624:94"/>is ſuch a neere relation between Chriſt and a Chriſtian, he is the head, and you the members, he is the Bridegroome, and you the Bride, he is the vine, and you the branches, Chriſt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but bid you wellcome; nor the father neither, for you are all his children; how wellcome is a friend, a childe, a husband, after ſeven yeares voyage, when returned; what love, what embraces doth then paſſe between them, powring heart into heart, as it were? How ſweetly did <hi>Joſephs,</hi> and his brethrens bowels yerne one towards another.</p>
               <p>O friends, Chriſt will one day embrace you in his armes, with his rowling bowels, like a husband his beloved wife, after ſeven yeares abſence, and you him with teares and kiſſes of joy and love. How glad was <hi>Dide</hi> queene of <hi>Carthage,</hi> when ſhe had <hi>Aeneas</hi> prince of <hi>Troy</hi> to look on and embrace. Well friends, time will come, when thou ſhalt have thy Chriſt to embrace and look on, who hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured more broiles ten thouſand times then all <hi>Aeneas</hi> feigned ones. Here Chriſt to look on, is admirable, and lovely too in broiles. O ſaith the Spouſe, <hi>Who is this that coms from</hi> Bozrah, <hi>with his garments dipped in blood. Iſaiah,</hi> 63.1.2. <hi>travelling in the greatnes of his ſtrength.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Chriſt the prince and Captain of our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, comes from the fields of ſlaughter like
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:171624:95"/>ſome noble champion, and hath his bloody armes, which doth declare him conquerour; ſo Chriſt here travels from <hi>Bozra,</hi> a field of ſlaughter; this I take to be the croſſe of Chriſt, on which he might be well ſaid, and did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer all the Churches enemies, yea, naild them to the croſſe, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh, by triumphing over them openly upon the croſſe.</p>
               <p>Well, in this field Chriſt ſlayes the law, ſinne and death, making this ſaying good, <hi>O death, I will be thy death.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.55. And now comes in warlick veſtures, which are dipped in this blood, declaring him to be the mighty conquerour,</p>
               <p>Well, the Spouſe ſits and ſees him at her window, comming from the field, which is the Spirit in the ſoule, through which ſhe lookes upon theſe mighty champions, Chriſt, Sinne, Death and Devils.</p>
               <p>Well, Chriſt foyls and ſpoyles all, by tramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on all, which being done, he leaves them dead, and comes away to refreſh himſelfe in glory; the Spouſe ſpies him in the way, and cries out, who is this? not that ſhee did not know Chriſt well enough, but ſhe is taken with Chriſt, in the beholding of Chriſt, thus bravely wins the field, which Chriſt never quited til all foild &amp; ſpoild &amp; the day his own.</p>
               <p>Well, Is the Soule now ſo taken with the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:171624:95"/>gallentry of Chriſt, that ſhe cryes out for joy and wonder? O then, how wilt thou be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, when thou ſhalt ſee this Chriſt againe, which heare is promiſed? yea, ſtroak the face of this Champion, Chriſt the Prince of our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; how will ſhe be taken with him then? ſaying, O my deare Chriſt, it was my enemies thou ingaged in <hi>Bozra,</hi> and if thou hadſt not conquered, my ſoule and thouſands more, had been undone for ever; but ſeeing thou didſt win the day, we will name and ſtile thee, moſt high, and excellent, and mighty Conquerour, King of Saints, Prince and Captaine of our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, which thou for ever ſhalt be called, by Saints and Angels, men and Devils; poore drooping ſinner, what doſt thou think of this day, and this Chriſt, who is thy Champion, thy Captaine and Salvation.</p>
               <p>I ſay, what doſt thou thinke O malencholy Chriſtian of this day, when thou ſhalt ſee the face of this Prince and Saviour, wilt thou not make one, to ſing his prayſes, to ſing his victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries over ſinne, death, hell, men and devils, which Angels now are doing, and ſo ſhalt thou; and this ſhall be thy reward too, a full reward indeed, for all thou ever didſt, or ſuffredſt.</p>
               <p>In the mean time bear up, bear up thy head, O drooping Chriſtian, Chriſt hath conquered
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:171624:96"/>ſinne, death, men and devils, and yet it may be thou feareſt all; O fooliſh ſinner, weake in faith, men are bound, ſinne and ſatan woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, yea, death and ſinne ſlaine too, and all by Chriſt in <hi>Bozra:</hi> what meanſt thou to be troubled? O but Sir, Sir, me thinks I ſee ſinne alive, and Satan looſe, yea, both in me; I will not deny, but thou mayſt think ſo; but all is not true that men doe thinke; but grant both theſe be in thee, yet if ſinne be wounded and Satan bound, one cannot long live, nor the other doe much miſcheife; if ſinne be woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it is to the heart, be ſure of that.</p>
               <p>And when Chriſt was wounded there by ſinne he ſtraight died; well, <hi>I</hi> am ſure Chriſt hath wounded ſinne there too, and it cannot live long; O Sir, Sir, it is livelier then ever, it ſtruggles more then ever. O friend, that is to me as cleare as the day, that ſinne is juſt a dying, every thing in nature will doe the like; what doſt thou ſee dying willing but a Saint, and he <hi>I</hi> muſt confeſſe, on this conſideration, that he ſhall live with God and Chriſt, and behold the face of God and Chriſt, as in the firſt words; <hi>I</hi> ſay, on this conſideration, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily he may with a great deale of willingneſſe die.</p>
               <p>But who beſides the Saint will? will man, or beaſt, or fiſh, or foule, or any other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:171624:96"/>No, no, the fiſh yawns and gapes, the fowle flutters, the beaſt beats it ſelfe and yels, though bound and muſled, man mournes and cries, alas, alas; why, muſt I die, and leave my hopes, my wife, my childe, my lands and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings, nay, friends and all? fetch the Doctor, quickly fetch the Doctor, ſave me if it be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, I faine would live a little longer; and thus he mournes to think on death; and when it comes and drawes neere to him, then he growns, and gaſps, and grinnes, and ſtares, ſtill ſtriving with it while breath doth laſt.</p>
               <p>Well friend, the fiſh yawns and gapes, the fowle flutters, the beaſt yels, man mournes and cries alas; what ſhall ſinne doe nothing, it were contrary unto nature, if it ſhould die without its throwes in thy ſoule.</p>
               <p>But ſtay, you ſaid Satan was bound; I, I did ſo, and ſo he is in two reſpects, Chriſt hath bound him up from hurting thee; Chriſt hath bound him up from forcing thee.</p>
               <p>Firſt, From hurting thee, you know if the moſt notorious theeving rogue in the world lyes bound in a lone womans houſe, hand and foot; there was no ground, nor cauſe of feare, he is bound hand and foot, what can he now doe, but curſe and ſwear? well, ſhe being a weak woman, is troubled and frighted, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, but when her husband comes
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:171624:97"/>home, her feares ceaſeth and are gone.</p>
               <p>Well friends know this, Chriſt hath bound Satan for a thouſand yeares, yea, for ever, from miſcheiving his Saints and Servants; and if he be in thee he is bound.</p>
               <p>O no, me thinks he is looſe, he doth ſo tempt me and accuſe me, I doe not know what to doe; it may be ſo, he doth tempt and accuſe thee; I did not ſay Chriſt had bound Satans tongue, no, he hath not, nor never will, whilſt the world ſtands; Satan ſhall have his tongue looſe to tempt ſome of his Saints, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe others, for divers good reaſons.</p>
               <p>This is one, When he cals on thee to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit this, or that great ſinne, thou mayſt call on Chriſt to keep thee from ſinne.</p>
               <p>A ſecond reaſon is this, When he accuſeth thee for thy ſinne, Chriſt would have thee pray and crave his pardon for thy ſinne; yea, beleeve it is pardoned, notwithſtanding his accuſing thee, which when thy ſoule doth by his power and ſtrength in thee, it brings much honour to Chriſt, yea, very much; but I will not ſtand now, to give thee any more reaſons, why Chriſt will not tie the Devils tongue.</p>
               <p>But remember theſe two, but the thing I ſaid, was, Chriſt hath bound Satan hand and foot, and ſo he hath from doing thee any miſcheife,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:171624:97"/>faſt enough; and yet it may be, he lyes thus bound in the middle of the floor, as I ſaid before; and raves, and curſeth thee, and ſtares at thee in thy houſe about thy calling, and this cauſes a great deale of trouble in thy ſoule; but when thy husband Chriſt comes home, which will be at noon in his diſcoveries, thy feare will be gone, and thou with joy wilt tell thy neighbours, I meane, thy chriſtian friends.</p>
               <p>Againe, Satan is bound from forcing thee; if a maid ſhould be tempted day and night, to part with her virginity, yet if ſhe conſent not, and the other have no power, but by conſent, what is ſhe the worſe, or her chaſtity the leſſer, no, it is rather greater if you will. So I ſay to thee, who talkſt of Satans temptations, what if Satan tempt thee day and night to part with thy virginity, or reſolution againſt ſuch and ſuch a ſin.</p>
               <p>Well, Satan tempts to yeild, yea, tempts thee day and night; doe not yeild by no means if he ſhould goe to force thee, Chriſt will come and helpe thee, or at leaſt excuſe thee, ſaying, thou art yet his chaſte and beloved Spouſe, and will not hide his face from thee, for all that.</p>
               <p>But in the fifth and laſt place, whereas God ſaith, <hi>They ſhall ſee my face;</hi> It doth imply
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:171624:98"/>that great and ſweet delight that God takes in his peoples preſence.</p>
               <p>God delights in all his workes, but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in his own people, <hi>O Iſrael whom I have created;</hi> God created all things for his praiſe, but Iſrael eſpecially, more then all his whole creation; God ſaid of all his works, that <hi>they were good,</hi> ſerving ſome deſigne, or other, but Iſrael his glory: <hi>O Jacob my ſervant, and Iſrael whom I have choſen,</hi> Iſa. 44.1, 2, 3. <hi>Feare not, O Jacob my ſervant, and Jeſhurum whom I have choſen;</hi> yea, thou art choſen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all times and worlds, <hi>Iacob have I loved,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>before Iacob had a being;</hi> but he is now brought forth by creation, for the glory of his grace, that he might ſhew the greatneſſe of his love to them, in diſcovering of himſelfe to be their God and Father, which he doth in Jeſus Chriſt, who is the expreſſe Image of his Fathers perſon, and ſo the very face of God, as I may ſo ſay. For in Chriſt he ſhewes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to the Saints a Father of love and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, yea, and a God, and fountain too of all delights.</p>
               <p>God diſcovers nothing in his Sonne, but love, delight and ſweetneſſe to the ſonnes of men: So that whereas God ſaith, he will ſhew his face, he meanes, he will ſhew you Chriſt, and in him his love, delight and pleaſure:
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:171624:98"/>which when it is once diſcovered to the ſoule, it ſo takes the ſoule, that it cryes out, O God, <hi>who is a God like unto thee?</hi> as <hi>Moſes</hi> once ſaid, <hi>How great, O God, is this goodneſſe, which thou haſt laid up for them that ſerve, love and feare thee;</hi> As <hi>David</hi> once ſaid, <hi>O God in thy preſence is life, and thy loving kindneſſe is better then life it ſelfe, Pſalme. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my lips ſhall praiſe thee;</hi> nothing is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then life, but his favour is better and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er too, ten thouſand times.</p>
               <p>Doth the favour and ſmiles of a Prince, ſo take the flattering Courtier, that he bleſſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as it were, in the obtaining of it, and ſaith, he is now a happy man, he hath now the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces eye and eare; he more delights in me, then all his noble favourites.</p>
               <p>O happy chriſtian, favourite of God and Chriſt, the Prince of princes, and nations too, as well as King of Saints; how wilt thou be delighted in theſe delights of God ſet on thee, and ſhewn unto thee in his Sonne. It is ſaid of him, <hi>I will make my firſt born higher then the princes of the earth;</hi> this is ſpoken of Chriſt, but it is as true of the Saints, in their creation, being the cheife of it; well God ſets up theſe higher then the Princes of the earth, as they are ſet up in his favour by his Son, for his own glory, to make himſelf a name by them.</p>
               <pb n="178" facs="tcp:171624:99"/>
               <p> Children, ſaith <hi>Solomon, are the glory of their parents,</hi> and ſo are the Saints too of God; namely, the glorie of his grace; by which he gets himſelfe a Name, and praiſe in the earth: O Iſrael praiſe the Lord, that made thee of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. <hi>O houſe of Jacob, praiſe ye the Lord, O all ye ſervants of his praiſe him day and night, for he hath magnified you, by his grace in his Son,</hi> and ſet you above men and Angels, in reſpect of union; and now, where would the riches of this grace appear to the world, but for the Saints.</p>
               <p>The world is blind, and ſees no glory, love, nor ſweetneſſe in him; but they, in Chriſt, ſee all, namely, a glory beyond all glories, a love ſurpaſſing all, a ſweetneſſe like a ſea, and they in the midſt, which fils the ſoules with admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and makes them like <hi>David</hi> cry out, and ſay, <hi>how great is thy goodneſſe, which thou haſt laid up in ſtore for them that feare, and ſerve thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God hath laid up in ſtore Jewels, Crowns, kingdoms; nay more, his own favour in Jeſus Chriſt, which they ſhall one day ſee, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſay as once the queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> did to <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, I have heard of thee, but not of halfe thy glory.</hi> So ſhall the Saints ſay, we have heard much of thee, O God and Father, and of thy glory: but never the halfe that we now ſee.
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:171624:99"/>One ſaid, thou art a God of love, and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; and another, of all delights and pleaſures, but we never heard halfe we now ſee, and find thee to be to our ſoules. O had the world known thee, they would have ownd thee, and counted thy favour better then life it ſelf, or heaven either: for it is thy preſence, love, and favour makes the heavens, heavens indeed to our ſoules. O God we met with ſprings of it <hi>in the valley of tears, but they were fountaines to us, and filled our ſouls with delights. Pſal.</hi> 84. <hi>v.</hi> 6. But now our joyes are double, and fountaines too, like ſeas, which breaks up every moment with new and freſh diſcoveries, and makes our ſoules admire and overflow with joy, which we have in thy preſence every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, freſh and greene, by ſeeing of thy face, which is the joy of heaven, and Saints, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels too: with all that do behold thee, as wee thy ſervants do, which once did live in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſaw thee not at all: but in the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowey creature, which hinted ſomething to us, but ſhort of what we ſee, or ever did imagine. O ſaith <hi>Paul, Eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, nor ever hath it entred into the heart of man to conceive, what God hath laid up for them that love him,</hi> this made us think, it was won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull, but now we find it ſo; yea, wonderfull indeed, beyond all wonders too, which Saints
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:171624:100"/>and Angels ſhall ever finde.</p>
               <p>And now in admiration of this wonder, we all, as one, cry out, <hi>Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty;</hi> Almighty in thy glory, Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in thy loves, and alſo for delights to us thy poore creatures, now ſwallowed up by plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures in the beholding of thee.</p>
               <p>O ſea of endleſſe ſweetneſſe, and ſun of all delights, and fountaine too of glory, what ſhall we ſay more of thee; thou art the heaven of heavens, and glory too of Saints, who now will ſing thy praiſe, and ever thee admire for all thy beauty, ſweetneſſe, and endleſſe life and glory, which Song ſhall all joine in, and make the heavens ring for ever in thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
               <p>But Lord, I do thy glory darken, to ſpeak ſuch low things of it, one ſtar cannot the heavens ſhow, nor thouſand ſuns, thy glory; much leſſe a poor worme, hint out thoſe ſeas of ſweetnes, which lies hid in thy preſence, till thou ſhalt ſhow thy face to wormes, duſt, and aſhes, created for thy praiſe.</p>
               <p>But let me winde up all in two words, one to the careleſſe ſinner, and another to the Saint, who is the man, to whom this promiſe is, of ſeeing his face: but what ſhall I ſay to thee? O happy Chriſtian, that ſerveſt God, more then is ſaid in theſe words, <hi>they ſhall ſee my
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:171624:100"/>face.</hi> Which doth imply his glory, love, ſweetneſſe, reward, and pleaſure, which he takes in you.</p>
               <p>This promiſe is ſure enough indeed to beare up thy Spirit againſt all frownes, jeares, and ſcornes, that thou maiſt meet with in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of this God. I ſay this promiſe ſure, is enough to encourage thee.</p>
               <p>And therefore, O precious Chriſtian, beare up, bear up, and be not wearie of well doing, for in due time, thou ſhalt have thy reward, if thou fainteſt not, which is to ſee his face.</p>
               <p>What will men do for the favour of a prince, and yet his favour is but a changeable thing, but the favour, and loving kindneſſe of God, abideth for ever; it is a favour from everlaſting abiding to everlaſting, running out in divers ſprings, election, creation, juſtification, and glorification in the higheſt heavens, with Saints and Angels for ever more, which is thy crowne, reward, and wages for all thy work for God and Chriſt. What wilt thou now ſit ſtill? or wilt thou give over running, as one thats weary, and ſit thee down with men and ſinners in creature vanities, which are a lie, and doth deceive all expectations, and ever will.</p>
               <p>But why ſhould I be jealous of thee, O pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Chriſtian, ſure, thou canſt not think of
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:171624:101"/>ſeeing his face, glory, love, and ſweetneſſe: but thy reſolutions are doubled in thee, to beleeve that God will ſo abundantly reward thee, for all thou ever didſt, or ſufferedſt for his ſake, or Name.</p>
               <p>But I ſhall cloſe up all with one word to the careleſſe ſinner, for whom my ſoul doth even weep to thinke upon that day; when hee ſhall be baniſhed from the face of this God, in whoſe preſence is fulneſſe of joy, and pleaſures for ever more, as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks in his Pſalmes.</p>
               <p>But in his abſence is miſery upon miſery: O ſaid <hi>Abſalom</hi> once, <hi>Let me ſee my fathers face, though he kill me.</hi> 2. Sam. 14.32. with what a longing was here now in <hi>Abſalom</hi> to ſee <hi>Davids</hi> face, who heretofore rebelliouſly ſought his life.</p>
               <p>Well, know this, O rebellious ſinner, time will come, that thou ſhalt weep; yea, bitterly weep as once <hi>Eſau</hi> did for <hi>Jacobs</hi> bleſſing; ſo thou, for a glimpſe of this face, glory, love, and ſweetneſſe of God; yea, thou ſhalt weep, and ſay as <hi>Abſalom,</hi> let me ſee thy face, O God, though thou kill me, and damne mee too.</p>
               <p>But will this prevail, no it will not, dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thou ſhalt be, but never ſee his face.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid, <hi>the wicked ſhall not ſee God,</hi> no
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:171624:101"/>nor never ſhall to their comfort. O ſaid Chriſt once to the Jewes, <hi>Ye ſhall ſeek me, but ſhall not find me, for whither I goe, ye cannot come,</hi> Iohn 7.34.</p>
               <p>God will one day ſay the ſame, to everie proud rebellious ſinner, <hi>ye ſhall ſeek me, but ſhall not find me,</hi> no, though you ſeek me with bitter teares, yet it will be all in vain, you may weep like <hi>Eſau</hi> but not prevail; though ſeas, and ſeas again to that be ſhed with ſenſe of miſerie, and bitter cries for ſight; yea, one glimmering ſight of my face and glorie, love and ſweetneſſe, it will be vain, yea all in vain.</p>
               <p>You might once, but muſt not ſee it now, no nor cannot for ſighs and ſobs with teares and cries; and then thy ſoul with heavy heart will mourning ſay, O my unhappie ſoul, what wilt thou now do, God will not be ſeen, but is wrapped up in diſpleaſure for ever, if this Sunne ſhould do the like, how would man and beaſt mourn, (though but for a mouth) and prize him too, when it againe ſhould ſhine: but O my poore ſoul, from thee is hid this Sunne, yea, this Sunnes Sunne, and glorie, Angels are this Sunnes Sunne, and God the Sunne and glorie too of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; but what is this to me, ſeeing he hath wrapt himſelf in diſpleaſure, and me in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſs,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:171624:102"/>by hiding of his face: Which when <hi>David</hi> once had a conceit of, mark what bitter groanes, and ſad complaints doth his dolourous ſoul then make, O ſaith he, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore me to the light of thy countenance, that the bones which thou haſt broken may rejoice,</hi> Mark this good mans expreſſions at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of the loſſe of Gods favour, <hi>O reſtore it,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that the bones which thou hast bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken may rejoyce.</hi> O friend, what a ſenſe was here in <hi>David,</hi> of a loſſe that he ſhould in the ſenſe of it think all his bones were bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</p>
               <p>Who knows the pain of one broken bone? much leſs of all his bones at once, well, if thou ſhouldeſt know all thy bones broken, yea and broken over again, is leſſe painfull, then the loſſe of this love, and favour which is ſeen in the face of God, though careleſſe ſinners little mind it for the preſent; but when the ſenſe of it ſhall break in upon thy ſpirit like mighty ſeas, how wilt thou be drownd for ever, hoping or expecting it again. O this loſs muſt needs break thy bones, yea, heart and ſoul too, over and over again.</p>
               <p>The child mourns for his fathers abſence, but more when he hides his face, and ſo the wife for her husband, but what is their grief or loſs to thine, unhappie ſinner, thou haſt loſt a father
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:171624:102"/>indeed, or at leaſt, one that would have beene a Father to thee when time was, in Ieſus Chriſt; yea, a ſweet and loving Father for them that have found him, have found him ſo to be, yea, a Father as farr excelling all relations and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers too for ſweetneſs, as the univerſall ſweetneſs does the ſingle Pink.</p>
               <p>Men may talk of losſes by wife and children, husbands, friends and Parents: but all is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing unto thine, O unhappie ſinner, they have loſt pebbles, but thou haſt loſt a Iewell, yea a God as farre excelling Iewels, Crowns and Kingdomes, as they for luſtre, beautie, worth and ſweetneſs, love, and love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, excell ſtraw, and ſtubble, chaffe, and vanity. Yea, and loſt it too for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, which muſt needs cut the ſoul and ſplit thy Spirit too, when it thinks on it. O ſaith a poore Soul, I have loſt the heaven of heavens, for duſt and aſhes; a few dying creatures ſaith the worlding, and I too, ſaith the wanton, for my <hi>Dalilah,</hi> this or that ſinne which at the laſt betrayed me <hi>Iudas</hi>-like, in-into mine enemies hands, death, hell and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, where I muſt lie, yea weep and wail, and ſee no God, no hope, no help, nor pity, for millions of yeares as that young man the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecarie once ſaid to his ſervant in his deſpair and horrour.</p>
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:171624:103"/>
               <p> And if then too, there were but any hopes to ſee God at laſt, it would be ſome comfort, but this everlaſting departure and never ſeeing more, is a hell to hell, and a hell in hell to think upon, which every careleſſe ſinner will one day find, though he now makes a ſhip of God, and thinks there is no danger of finding him, or at leaſt finding him when he needs, he is ſo mercifull, that if he crie but <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> in a dying houre, God is ſo near and mercifull, that he will be ſtraight found.</p>
               <p>I will not leſſen his mercie, and ſay abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely thou ſhalt not; but friend, let me tell thee, thouſands, and ten thouſands have found it otherwiſe, witneſſe <hi>Francis Spira,</hi> and thoſe deſpairing Sinners, which thou ſeeſt daily dying ſo, which would give a thouſand worlds might they live a little longer. O ſaith one in his burning feaver would I could live to ſee God, a reconciled God in the face of Ieſus Chriſt, I would be contented to lie a thouſand yeares in this Feaver; and I too, ſaith another in this Gout; and I too, ſaith a third, with his bowells twiſted in his belly, which pains are all intollerable, yet all would fain live in them to find a God before they die.</p>
               <p>O fooliſh man, O fooliſh ſinner, what ſhall I like thee unto, but unto that ſimple man, that built his houſe upon the ſands of peradventure.
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:171624:103"/>I hope, and thinke to finde God when I die; for all theſe <hi>Puritans</hi> be ſo ſtritkt, though I take my pleaſure, and live in my ſinnes, and doe as my neighbours, Mr. <hi>Cuſtome,</hi> and the reſt; well friend, I will take thee at thy word, peradventure thou mayſt: But wilt thou venture thy ſoule, thy deare and pretious ſoul, upon a peradventure? O fooliſh ſinner, haſt thou ever another ſoule to ſave if this miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? doſt not thou loſe all, and for a perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, which may take, and yet it is a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand to one if it doth?</p>
               <p>But with this parable, before me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioned, I ſhal conclude; &amp; now for thy ſouls ſake, hearken to me whoever thou art, that readeſt theſe lines, &amp; this little book, mind me, for it is a truth, and ſhall be ſo, when thou and I am rotten, that Chriſt is the rock, yea, the rock of ages, and whoever builds on him ſhall ſtand; yea ſtand, and ſtand firme, when the windes blow and whiſtle, and raines fall like hailſtones driven by the winde, and the ſtormes beat, yet thou ſhalt ſtand, and ſtand firme, in all theſe ſtormes, and troubles, and afflictions, and temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; yea, in death and judgement too, ſhalt thou ſtand, where millions, yea, and millious too, ſhall fall whilſt thou ſtands firme on thy rock Chriſt, thy ſure foundation, and ſee the face of God too for thy comfort; after all

But how thou muſt build upon this rock know, and let all the world know, it is by the mighty power of faith wrought in the heart, by the eternall Spirit of the mighty God, and not by the workes which we doe, or can doe, by all created power.</p>

O nimble, quick, &amp; cruell death! how haſt thou ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len my neareſt, ſweet, and deareſt comforts? Odeath, where hadſt thou this full and large Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion? Was it given thee by chance? O no, I know it was not; thou canſt not take by that Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a bird, a ſparrow; much leſs a daughter, ſonne, and wife. O death, this Commiſſion it was from the Lord, for he gives and takes, <hi>Iob</hi> the firſt, <hi>The Lord gives, and the Lord takes, and bleſſed be his name.</hi> O friends, death hath no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion but from him, the Lord, that gives, and takes, and bleſſed be his name; yea, bleſſed (I ſay)
<pb facs="tcp:171624:106"/>be his holy name; for what he hath now taken from me, he firſt did give unto me. Why ſhould I not then praiſe his name? Oh that I could, and you my friends, for all he gives, and all he takes! And that we may know firſt it is your duty; yea, I ſay, is your duty, and all theirs that truly feare God, to ſubmit with patience to his will, and bleſſe his name for all his diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the which I will prove by ſome examples. I could give you many inſtances; as firſt, that of old <hi>Eli,</hi> concerning his Sonnes, which you may read in <hi>Samuel,</hi> the firſt Book, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>verſ.</hi> 18. O with what a ſweet ſpirit doth he receive that ſad meſſage con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb facs="tcp:171624:107"/>his ſons, <hi>It is the Lord, let him doe with me what he pleaſe.</hi> O ſweet and ſoure! A ſad meſſage is told good old <hi>Eli</hi> concerning his ſons; yea, a very ſad one, at which the eares of men ſhould tingle: But yet ſaith <hi>Eli</hi> unto <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel, It is the Lord, and let him doe what ſeemes him good.</hi> A ſecond inſtance, is that of <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam. Chap.</hi> 15. <hi>verſ.</hi> 26. Who was faine to fly, with the Ark of God, and his ſervants, for his life, from his habitation, by reaſon of <hi>Abſolom's</hi> unnaturall and deceitfull Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion. Well, many weep for this good mans danger and affliction and ſo doth he, for he goes from <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> with his head covered, and his eyes weeping; but yet
<pb facs="tcp:171624:107"/>ſweetly thus ſaying, <hi>If he have any pleaſure in me, he will bring me back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine; otherwiſe, loe, here I am, let him doe with me what he pleaſe.</hi> O what a ſweet and Saint-like Spirit was here in <hi>David! Let him doe what he pleaſe, loe, here am I to ſubmit.</hi> A third inſtance, is that of <hi>Paul,</hi> who makes this his deſire, <hi>To glorifie Chriſt in his body:</hi> But whether it be by life or death, <hi>Paul</hi> cares not, ſo Chriſt be glorified. I could inſtance above all in Chriſt, the patterne of all, who ſweetly ſayes thus in the Garden, <hi>Not my will, but thine be done.</hi> But I ſhall only mention in <hi>Iob,</hi> whoſe ſweet ſubmiſſion to God in his great afflictions, I little minded, till within theſe few dayes. I don't
<pb facs="tcp:171624:108"/>remember ſcarſe when I read one of <hi>Iobs</hi> Chapters. O how many ſad meſſages was brought to him; not in one week after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, like mine; but in one day did his ſad meſſengers come tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling in with heavy meſſages, concerning his ſheep, oxen, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, ſons and daughters: well, ſaith <hi>Iob, The Lord gives and takes, and bleſſed be his name.</hi> What fuller ſubmiſſion could there be in a gracious heart, then here is in theſe words? But let me give you three or foure reaſons why a gracious heart ſhould ſweetly ſubmit to Gods will; and the firſt reaſon ſhall be this, the Holineſſe of his will; a Saint ſees in the will of God a holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb facs="tcp:171624:108"/>and therefore let things goe how they will, yet thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineſt holy, <hi>O thou that inhabiteſt Eternity. Paul</hi> ſayes, he workes all things according to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of his owne will; ſurely, that muſt needs be holy, that is wrought according to the will and counſell of a holy God. A ſecond reaſon why a gracious heart ſhould ſweetly ſubmit to the will of God, is the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignity of Gods will above the creature; he doth what ever he will, and all what ever he will; and therefore ſaith <hi>Paul, who hath reſiſted his will?</hi> Shall the potſheard ſtrive with the Potter, or the creature with the Creator? No, nor the ſervant with his Maſter
<pb facs="tcp:171624:109"/>neither; much leſſe a gratious heart with his God and Maker <hi>Teach me to doe thy will O God</hi> (ſaith <hi>David,</hi> and every gracious heart too. It is our prayer to ſay, <hi>Thy will be done,</hi> and it would be our perfection to ſubmit. A third reaſon why a gracious heart ſhould ſubmit to Gods will, is the goodneſſe of Gods will, the will of God is good in all his working to his people. So ſaith <hi>Paul, all things worke together for the beſt to them that feare God.</hi> Yea, thoſe vvorkings of Gods vvill, vvhich moſt croſſe nature, doth he ſee a goodnes in. O that I had more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to ſee this to; but however a gracious heart ſees a goodnes in concluſion, vvhich he doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knovvledge
<pb facs="tcp:171624:109"/>in the will of God; <hi>It was good for me</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) that I was afflicted, for before I went aſtray.</hi> And truly, affliction doth often cauſe a Saint to looke to his wayes, which he is too apt in proſperity to be mindleſſe of. Let us ſearch, and try our wayes, (ſaith the Church) in afflictions; and ſo ſaith a gracious heart in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſmart affliction. O how good is that will of God, that wils thy affliction for ſo good an end! And thus you ſee three reaſons why a gracious heart ſhould ſweetly ſubmit to Gods Will; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of its Holineſſe, its Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignity, and Goodneſſe. One word or two more, and then I hvae done. Firſt then, labour
<pb facs="tcp:171624:110"/>with your owne hearts to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to Gods Will, for in every ſubmiſsion, yee ſerve ſome glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous deſigne of God; and for this reaſons ſake, labour quietly to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit. O that my ſoule did know well his deſigne, and reaſon, why hee hath dealt ſo with me as hee hath, in a way of affliction! my afflictions are yet like the black ſide of a cloud. O that I could ſee the bright ſide, the glory of God, which every ſtrong Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ſees, and by ſeeing, quietly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit. 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. Let us labour to ſubmit our wils to Gods, for conformities ſake; and here let vveake Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans take the example of ſtrong, and they, the example of Chriſt. <hi>Who for the Glory that was ſet before him,
<pb facs="tcp:171624:110"/>endured the Croſſe, and deſpiſed the ſhame.</hi> Thirdly, let us ſubmit our vvills to God, for it is the ſureſt vvay, and the ſafeſt. Firſt, it is the ſureſt, if you vvould not offend God, for if ye ſtorme yee ſinne, and offend God, vvhich a gracious heart ſhould be carefull of. Secondly, it is the ſafeſt vvay; the ſturdy oakes reſiſt the vvinde, and are ſplit; but the gentle reed, by yeelding, ſtands. Doth God take a child? yeeld. Doth he take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother? yeeld. Doth he take all? yeeld. Doth he take a Wife, a Husband? yeeld. If thou doſt not, he can take thy ſoule, and throvv it into apprehenſions of his vvrath, vvhich vvill make thee roare, as if thy bones vvere bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
<pb facs="tcp:171624:111"/>yea, all thy bones; but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially yeeld to God, for he cannot onely take all thy comforts from thee, but thy very ſoul, and throw it into hell too.</p>
            <p>O my friends, let us yeeld to God, for there is ſafety in it, I have heard ſome miniſters ſay of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine,</hi> Lord ſaith he, cut me, hack me, kill me, ſo thou ſave my ſoul, he hath delt ſo by my wife, ſhe hath had cutting afflictions two or three days travelling by a child as with <hi>Samuel,</hi> which ſome of you, my friends, well know, and as many by his loſſe, his loſſe, and the reſt, muſt needs be cutting; well, thus was this poor woman cut, and at laſt cut of life too: O all cut, but her ſoule ſaved, and
<pb facs="tcp:171624:111"/>that I verely beleeve on good grounds, and now though here lyes before us her body coffind, yet my ſoule cannot but rejoyce in her ſoules ſalvation, one thing a little troubles me, and another thing would have ſplit my very heart, if I did not beleeve it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently; that, that a little troubles me is, that I ſhould be no more kind to ſo good a body, yet I hope and doe beleeve, none, no not one of all you can condemne me but my heart doth a little, I thought to enjoy her when wee were old, and to be ſo kind to her as we might be all along, my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, O husbands and wives, is, yea, I wiſh you, pray you, intreat you, to look on one another as
<pb facs="tcp:171624:112"/>as parting dying yoake-fellows, and if you doe, how ſweet, how kinde, how loving will you be, when brethren are called to part farre aſunder, the one to croſſe the ſeas, and the other to go a prentiſe, how ſvveetly will they embrace one the other; do ye ſo, I pray ye do ſo, <hi>it is a duty well pleaſing to God,</hi> no love but Gods &amp; Chriſts love, ſhould be above this mutuall love of wife and husbands love. O ſaith <hi>Paul, love your wives as Chriſt loved his Church,</hi> that is, for ſincerity &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, I, &amp; quantity too: but that is impoſſible, hovv ever, it holds forth that greatneſſe of affection that ſhould be betvveen the Wife &amp; husband. But the main thing, as I ſaid before, vvhich grievs me to think, is, how unfaithfull a hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
<pb facs="tcp:171624:112"/>I have beene to her ſoul, and that in theſe particulars. Firſt, that I ſhould put up ſo few prayers, &amp; them ſo cold; I have been as apt to ſay, I hope God will bleſſe us in our eſtates, I friends, I was as apt to ſay ſo, and come love, let us look to the World, as oft as to ſay, look to thy ſoule and Chriſt, either more worth then ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Worlds. O my friends, I hope you be not guilty like me, in this particular, if you be, it may trouble you more, then you are aware of one day. O if I had doubted that her ſoul had miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caried, how heavy, heavy would this have been; yea, how ſadly ſhould I have followed her corps to the garve; a body miſcarrying,
<pb facs="tcp:171624:113"/>is not eaſily born; but a ſoul miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carrying, who can bear it. O friends, love your wives, and husbands ſoules, as much above their bodies, as ye doe their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies above their clothes; it will do the wife good to think, that the husbands ſoule is in heaven ſmiling, whilſt ſhee and her friends are mourning for the corps in the coffin: when my wife was ſick, and I thought it might be unto death, then, then I thought how many nights my poor wife would call on mee in the night watch, ſweetheart, husband, let us talk of Chriſt a little, lets have ſome ſpirituall diſcourſe, pray, be not ſo ſleepy, but talk to me; to which, I like a dead man, a ſtock,
<pb facs="tcp:171624:113"/>or ſtone would ſay nothing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times, or elſe I am weary, or ſleepy, or ſome ſuch kind of ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſh anſwere, and ſo neglect a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall and ſweet opportunity, in which I might have done her ſoul and mine own good, <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks <hi>of communing with his own heart in the night ſeaſon.</hi> The wives, the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands heart ſhould be as one ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to one another, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes mindful of each one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers welfare, eſpecially in a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ſenſe, and indeed this was the main end and reaſon, why I deſired leave from you to ſpeak a few words to you, my friends; and truely, if I were now to be coffind for the grave to morrow, this ſhould be my advice to you, my
<pb facs="tcp:171624:114"/>laſt and ſolemne advice to you; yea, to all of you my friends, to take all advantages by night and day, to doe one anothers ſoules good. O if that be ſaved; how wil it comfort &amp; rejoyce your hearts, when you in a melancholly way walke to view againe the grave of your wife, your husband: how will the heart be lifted up with ſuch kind of ſweet thoughts as theſe, though here lies rotting the fleſh and bones of my wife, my husband, yet their fouls are with God and Chriſt, with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac, and Iacob</hi> in the kingdome of God, ſinging, farewell all ſin and ſorrow, which now ſhall be no more.</p>
            <p>Oh, hovv do the ſoules there
<pb facs="tcp:171624:114"/>ſing its triumphs over ſinne, and ſorrow, death, hell, and miſery, devils, men, and dangers. The abſence of a friend is not ſo much a grief, as the condition of him in his abſence: if a friend be in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, ye onely mourn for his abſence, but if yee doubt he is in miſery, ye mourn double. Truly an abſent ſoule doubted to be loſt is the greateſt trouble; yea, the greateſt that can be in this World. I think it, I, in my conſcience really think it; and on this conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, my ſoul did even weep, weep, till God did further fully confirme my faith, in her ſouls ſalvation, if ſhe ſhould die: But I had reaſon to beleeve this of her before, for many a time had I ſeen
<pb facs="tcp:171624:115"/>her weep for want of Chriſt; for ſin and corruption; for ſinne, <hi>Bleſſed are they that mourn for ſin, for they ſhall be comforted,</hi> which I now beleeve ſhe is, and beleeving this; truely, my ſoule cannot but now rejoyce in her ſoules ſalvation, whoſe body lies here coffind, I ſay, her ſouls ſalvation, I doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in, who never did much work for Chriſt, but brought glory to Chriſt, by beleeving ſtrongly in Chriſt to the very laſt moment.</p>
            <p>And that ye may know I do not flatter, which I would not for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good in the World, in ſuch a caſe as this. I will read you a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of what ſhe beleeved concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning her ſelf, and what ſhe ſpake
<pb facs="tcp:171624:115"/>concerning others the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe died, and of this I will read ſomething to you, which I writ down, thinking it would be ſweet and comfortable to read another day, when I ſhould think upon her.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>O God, not my will, but thy will be done.</hi> Lord, what is this that lies ſo bitter here, pointing to her ſtomack.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lord, if it be thy will, remove it.</hi> O Lord, thou haſt removed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny bitter paines from mee in my dayes, bleſſed be thy holy Name.</p>
            <p>I rejoyce to hear thy ſweet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions. O ſweet heart. I am full, I am full within; but ſo
<pb facs="tcp:171624:116"/>weak, not able to ſpeake what I enjoy.</p>
            <p>O, that all my friendes in the world were here, I would bid them live to Chriſt, and live in Chriſt; but alas, they cannot by their owne ſtrength. Well, I am willing to leave all, to goe to Chriſt, indeed I am, indeed I am. What will all things avail me, but Chriſt; the Lord hath not threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned mee with death, nor ſinne; furely, the Lord hath been good to me above all women.</p>
            <p>I asked her once againe of her aſſurance, ſhee ſeemed a little troubled, ſaying, O Lord, ſweet heart, why, do you not beleeve me, when I have told you ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
<pb facs="tcp:171624:116"/>I have peace in my conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and am verily perſwaded of Gods love in Chriſt to my ſoule.</p>
            <p>If I were not, what would it do me good to tell you a lye, and ſay, I am. The Lord hath not laid one ſinne to my charge, the Lord does not lay ſinne to our charge: But I mean, hee hath not ſuffered Satan to do it; for ſurely he would if the Lord would have ſuffered him; but he hath not, no, there is not ſo much as one ſin brought to my minde, ſo as to doubt of the pardon of it, no not ſo much as one ſinne of all my many ſins. Satan was wont in my former lying, into tempt me, and accuſe
<pb facs="tcp:171624:117"/>me; but God hath now chaind him up In my firſt lying in, the nurſe having careleſſely one night left me alone, ſuppoſing, I had been aſleep, Satan comes then, and mightily accuſed me, and tempted mee ſtrongly, to make away my ſelf; ſo I knockt, and called for the nurſe, or ſomebody, for two or three houres, no body heard me, well then I aroſe out of my bed, and laid every thing out of the way, which Satan would have had me miſchief my ſelf, or child, who was then in the cradle; which having done, I went into my bed again, and ſweat, and prayed, and cryed with all my ſtrength; yet notwithſtanding, Satan continued ſtill his tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb facs="tcp:171624:117"/>and told me, look, there lies thy garters, which I preſently catcht, and threw away, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued praying by the ſtrength of God, ſo at laſt the nurſe came, and Satan left tempting me.</p>
            <p>God that brought mee to this weakneſſe, can raiſe me, and will, or take me to himſelf.</p>
            <p>One asked, if ſhee was confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the faith; yes truly, I am confirmed; ye are a poor creature, ſaid he, nay, I am rich in Chriſt. O I wait with patience, to ſee what God will do with mee.</p>
            <p>Sweet heart, I am perſwaded, you will goe to Chriſt, as ſure as <hi>Abraham and Iſaac</hi> are with him.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:171624:118"/>
            <p> I ſaid ſhe, ſo I am too, or elſe I were a miſerable creature to lie here as I doe.</p>
            <p>I have both inward, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward comfort; I praiſe my God.</p>
            <p>O my dear husband, ſerve God with ſincerity of heart, and he wil bleſſe thee and thy little family.</p>
            <p>Coſin <hi>Barwick,</hi> I pray, certifie my friends, all my friends in the countrey, that my husband hath been a loving husband to me all along.</p>
            <p>I do not flatter in my ſpeaking, but what God brings to my thoughts, I ſpeak to you.</p>
            <p>I thank God, I am not afraid
<pb facs="tcp:171624:118"/>to die, I have trembled ere now to think of death.</p>
            <p>O how hath Chriſt led mee by the hand through this wildernes of my afflictions all along.</p>
            <p>My deare husband, marry one that fears God, and loves thee ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well, or elſe ſhee will quickly bring thee to my condition.</p>
            <p>Keep this maid, for ſhe is a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious maid.</p>
            <p>To all my friends, I wiſh eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall happineſſe: but they live in a heatheniſh place.</p>
            <p>She called her apprentiſe, ſaid, <hi>Robert,</hi> ſee you ſerve God, read the Scriptures, ſearch the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb facs="tcp:171624:119"/>you will finde the ſweetnes of them when you are old. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what I ſay, they are the words of a dying miſtreſſe, do not neglect the Scriptures, nor thy maſters buſineſſe, nor be deluded with idle boyes; and ſo puld off a ring, and gave it him, willing him not to forget her counſell, &amp; <hi>to ſerve his maſter, not with eye-ſervice; but with ſingleneſſe of heart, pleaſing God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>She called for a Chriſtian friend, who did often viſit her, who an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, ſhe was there O ſaid ſhe, I have all my comforts about me: God who is all in all, and you my creature-comforts, who are a comfort to me ſo long as I am in
<pb facs="tcp:171624:119"/>this tabernacle of fleſh. O I am a going, but before you, and all you muſt follow after.</p>
            <p>To a friend, ſhe ſaid, pray, be you not troubled, if God ſhould lay his hand of affliction, and take ſome, or al your children away, as he hath mine, ye may finde a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in it, when ye come to die.</p>
            <p>God hath done great things for me, for he hath taken me by the hand, and led mee through the wilderneſſe, I, and that by a hand of love, and not by an yron rod.</p>
            <p>She ſent for a neighbour, &amp; ſaid, in love I ſend for you, &amp; in love I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire you to ſerve Ieſus Chriſt. O but you cannot by your own ſtrength: but he will give you ſtrength, if
<pb facs="tcp:171624:120"/>you can lay hold on his Promiſes, ye are of a good nature, but do not let men, and company abuſe that; but ſerve God, and hee will lead you through the wilderneſſe by his hand when ye come to die, as he doth now me; and therefore ſerve him; naturally you cannot, but he will give you ſtrength. O ſearch the Scriptures for there you will find eternall happineſſe, I hope you will, and if God give you ſtrength to do it, then he will bleſſe you, and alſo bleſſe your family: I pray, remember the words of a dying neighbour; I pray God you may.</p>
            <p>A friend asking how ſhee did, anſwered, I doe well, I have no paine; but joy, and peace, and
<pb facs="tcp:171624:120"/>comfort. A friend coming late at night, asking her, how it was with her, ſhe anſwered, I am well, I praiſe God, and have a full aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and accompliſhment of all the promiſes made good, holding up her hand, being the laſt friend that viſited her that night; The Doctor comming to ſee her, ſaid, God catches ſome, and ſome he drawes by degrees. I finde that, ſaid ſhe, for I am going to Chriſt.</p>
            <p>After a kind of trance, in which I thought ſhe would have depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſhe ſaid, Sweet heart, Satan and I had a bout juſt now, but I got the better of it, for I got hold on Chriſt, and would not let him goe.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:171624:121"/>
            <p> A little while after, lifting up her hands, after another trance, ſhe ſaid, O Chriſt, and by and by, O Chriſt, and againe with a ſoftly voyce, O Chriſt, I will not let thee goe, and about a quarter of an houre after, being a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe died, I askt, if ſhee had Chriſt and her comforts ſtill, ſhe anſwered, I I, vvhich vvere the laſt vvords ſhe ſpake.</p>
